## Don't Talk to Cops

*[10 reasons why adapted from RevLeft's police episode](https://revolutionaryleftradio.libsyn.com/red-hot-take-dont-talk-to-cops)*

1. Talking to the police cannot and will not help you.
Talking to the police cannot make any difference.
Nobody can talk their way out of an arrest.
No matter how savvy or intelligent you think you might be you will not convince them that you are innocent and any good statements that
may help you that you tell police cannot
be introduced into evidence because of
hearsay rules. It's a lose-lose situation, so don't talk to the police.

2. Even if you're guilty,
and you want to confess and get it off
your chest, you still shouldn't talk to
the police. There's plenty of time to
confess and admit guilt later why rush
the inevitable. First, hire an attorney,
let them do their work, and maybe you
will win your case. It's much harder to
win when there is a confession. For
example, do you know what happens if the
cop cannot be located and there is no
confession? The case gets dismissed. It's
not a universal rule, but it's more
common than you might think,
so don't talk to the police.

3. Even if you are innocent,
it's easy to tell some little white lie.
In the course of a statement when people
assert their innocence they sometimes
exaggerate their statements and tell a
little white lie on accident. That same
lie could be later used to destroy
your credibility at trial so don't talk
to the police.

4. Even if you are
innocent and you only tell the truth and
you don't tell any little white lies, it
is possible to give the police some
detail of information that can be used
to convict you. If you make any statement
it could later be used against you. For
example: "I did not kill that guy. I was
not around the area when it happened. I
don't have a gun. I've never owned a gun.
I never liked the guy but-". Bingo, we just found your incriminating
statement "I never liked the guy", so don't
talk to police.

5. Even
if you were innocent and you only tell
the truth and you don't tell any little
white lies and you don't give the police
any information that can be used against
you to prove motive or opportunity, you
still should not talk to the police
because of the possibility that the
police might not recall your statement
with 100% accuracy.
Nobody has perfect memor--that includes
law enforcement--at that point it's your
word against theirs. Don't talk to police.

6. Even if you're
innocent and you only tell the truth and
your entire statement is videotaped so
that the police don't have to rely on
their memory, an innocent person can
still make some innocent assumption
about a fact or state some detail about
the case they overheard on the way to
the police station, and the police will
assume that the only way that suspect
could have known that fact or that
detail is if he was in fact guilty. If
you overhear a fact from someone else
and later adopted as your own, it can be
used to crucify you at trial. Don't talk
to police.

7. Even if
you're innocent, and you only tell the
truth in your statement and you give the
police no information that can be used
against you and the whole statement is
videotaped, a suspect's answer can still
be used against him if the police
(through no fault of their own) have any
evidence that any of the suspects
statements are false--even if they are
really true. Honest mistakes by witnesses
can land you in jail. Why take the risk?
Don't talk to the police.

8. The police do not
have authority to make deals or grant a
suspect leniency in exchange for getting
a statement. Law enforcement personnel do
not have authority to make deals, grant
you immunity, or negotiate plea
agreements. The only entity with that
authority is the county or Commonwealth
attorney in state court and the US
attorney in federal court. The officers
will tell you that they do, but they are
lying. They lie constantly. Don't talk to
the police.

9. Even if a suspect is
guilty and wants to confess, there may be
mitigating factors which justify a
lesser charge. You may be accused of
committing one offense when in fact you
are guilty of a lesser one. By confessing
to the higher offense you are throwing
away bargaining chips. The prosecutor can
try the case with your confession to the
higher offense. There is no reason to
confess. Don't talk to the police

10. Even for a
completely honest and innocent person, it
is difficult to tell the same story
twice in exactly the same way. If trial
is the first time you tell your story,
then there is no other statement by you
to contradict any of your facts. However,
if you have told your story twice, once
at trial and once to the police, you are
probably going to mess up some facts. It's human nature. A good
cross-examination by a prosecutor will
tear you apart, so don't talk to the
police.

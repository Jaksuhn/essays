## Prologue

Humans, together, form societies. We help each other. We live by each other's happiness - not by each other's misery. We do not hate, do not despise, do not hurt one another. Together, humanity lives on this vast Earth. Earth is rich with enough resources to provide for every one that lives on it. We have the capabilities of living free and filling lives, but have lost our way.

The soul of man has been tainted, has barraged the world with hate, has caused great misery and bloodshed. Humanity has developed. Created advances, tools, machines - machines that give abundance. But that was not enough. Greed has overcome humanity and left us with an unfillable void of want. We think too much and feel too little. We have created great machines but we have not created a great humanity. We have become smarter and more clever, but we have not become more kind. Without kindness, caring, honestly, loyalty, trust and wiseness, life is devoid of all that is good and left with a violent evil. What good is that world?

From the horses to ships, to locomotives, to the planes in the sky, from radio to phones, to television, to the internet, all have brought humanity closer together on this large world. The nature of these inventions speaks for the cries of brotherhood - for unity of us all. This message has the potential of reaching billions of men, women, and children alike - victims of a system that deprive us, imprison us, torture us.

The misery that plagues us is not the way of the world. It is but another form of greed - the bitterness of a spiteful few who fear a changing world. The power that the spiteful possess is not their own - it is the power of the people - of humanity. Just as that power was taken from us, it can be taken back. Do not give in to those that rule in their own interest - to those that do not care about you, enslave you, tell you what to do, what to think, how to feel. They see you as as a lesser animal and use you as cannon fodder to fuel their own self interests. They do not treat you like what you are - humans. Those men are like the machines we created - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts. Humans are not machines. We are not lesser than any one else. Humans care for each other - that is the cornerstone of societies around this great Earth. You have humanity in your heart.

You, the people, have the power - the power to create not just machines, but happiness. You have the abilities to make this life free and filling, wonderful and beautiful. That power must be used. Let us use that power together - to unite. In the name of democracy, we shall fight for a new world - one where we all prosper, where we are secure in our lives, where every one has a chance, has an opportunity, where the right to live is not decided by those who do not care. Tyrants say these things to us and use it to rise to power. They lie to each and every one of us. They do not fufill that promise, nor did they ever intend to. Tyrants use those promises to free themselves, not the people that helped them. We must fight to fufill that promise. We must free the world of the oppression - to rid the world of separation, of greed, of hate, of intolerance. We must fight for a world of reason and prosperity, a world where advancement leads to the happiness of all people. People of all nations, of all lands, unite!

## Capitalism

Capitalism is the current economic system of the world. It is an economic system by which the means of production, the country's trade and industry, is controlled by private individuals or private corporations instead of either the state or the people. Why is capitalism being framed as **the** issue of the world? The system that we live in is as deep as you can go when you are digging for problems. Inequality is a problem, yes, but what causes that divide? Why is capitalism being framed as the problem and not some other system? Currently capitalism is the system used by the every country in the world. An argument can be made for Cuba, the only country in the world with >50% public industry control, however even that country has caused debates among socialists as to whether it truly can be considered socialist, or at the very least not-capitalist. Has capitalism been working for humanity?

### Fundamentals
These are problems that are innate to capitalism itself. They cannot be fixed (either completely or at all).

**Accumulation of capital** is the basis of capitalism. Examples within our society include rent, interest, profit, royalties, or capital gains.<sup>[[2.1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_accumulation)</sup> Now, why is this bad? Capitalism is inherently an **everexpanding system**. This means that they must continue to accumulate capital if they wish to remain capitalists, for if they did not they would lose to competitors. Eventually you reach a level of worker and land exploitation in your own country that is not sustainable, so you expand operations around the globe.<sup>[[2.2]](http://rbutler.sdsu.edu/gurely2.htm)</sup> The need for capital accumulation often leads to the generation of wasteful industries that solely exist for profit.<sup>[[2.3]](https://monthlyreview.org/2009/11/01/what-needs-to-be-done-a-socialist-view)[[2.4]](https://web.archive.org/web/20100716140329/http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/may10/page23.html)</sup> A final note about the effects of accumulation of capital is the creation of non-productive industries that serve to further capital accumulation and nothing else. The most notable example of this being the financial industry, which is one of the leading causes of financial bubbles, which ultimately lead to economic downturns at best and economic depressions at worst.<sup>[[2.5]](https://web.archive.org/web/20140228090631/http://www.rdwolff.com/content/economic-crisis-socialist-perspective)[[2.6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929)[[2.7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970s_energy_crisis)[[2.8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_1980s_recession)[[2.9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_1990s_recession)[[2.10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble)[[2.11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007–2008)[[2.12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_debt_crisis)</sup>

Another core property of capitalism is competition. Many capitalists believe this to be a fundamental right of humans - to be able to go out freely and innovate and compete with others within society.<sup>[[3.1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism)[[3.2]](http://capitalism.org/category/competition/)</sup> The fundamental flaw of competition, however, is its **lack of efficiency** for innovation and creation. Instead of having the best minds grouped together and cooperate to innovate and create, you have them competing against each other.<sup>[[3.3]](http://www.charleswarner.us/articles/competit.htm)[[3.4]](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/235229)[[3.5]](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/compete_or_cooperate)</sup> One product of the competition market are patents/copyrights. These laws have been shown to decrease innovation.<sup>[[3.6]](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/496/transcript)[[3.7]](http://www.edegan.com/wiki/images/8/88/Heller_Eisenberg_%281998%29_-_Can_Patents_Deter_Innovation_The_Anticommons_In_Biomedical_Research.pdf)</sup> Instead of the patent system being used to *temporarily* provide the inventor with some guaranteed return on investment, the system has been abused and changed, the most notable example being the corporation Disney lobbying the United States' Congress to extend the length of copyright protection in order to prevent their animated character "Mickey Mouse" from entering public domain.<sup>[[3.8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act)</sup>

The exact statistics on **poor resource allocation** for basics such as homes, food and water were talked about in the [Capitalism](#capitalism) section, so this section will show other examples of improper resource allocation *specifically* because of it's unprofitability.
 * A vaccine for Lyme disease existed and was available until 2002 when it was pulled from the market for "lack of consumer demand".<sup>[[4.1]](https://www.cdc.gov/lyme/prev/vaccine.html)</sup>
 * Cities within the United States make it illegal or heavily restricted to donate and feed homeless people.<sup>[[4.2]](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2014/10/22/357846415/more-cities-are-making-it-illegal-to-hand-out-food-to-the-homeless)</sup> Why is this the case? Because if the homeless were given food for free that would be less potential food that could by bought either by or for them.
 * Example of inadequate money allocation to healthcare: "Shane Patrick Boyle, a founder of Zine Fest Houston, died on March 18 after his GoFundMe campaign to pay for insulin came up $50 short."<sup>[[4.3]](https://www.thenation.com/article/alex-azar-trumps-hhs-pick-has-already-been-a-disaster-for-people-with-diabetes/)</sup>
 * Pfizer halts research into alzheimer's and parkinson's treatments due to unprofitability.<sup>[[4.4]](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/01/08/576443442/pfizer-halts-research-efforts-into-alzheimers-and-parkinsons-treatments)</sup>
 * Daranide, a disease used to treat eye disease glaucoma, used to cost nothing. After being acquired by the company Strongbridge Biopharma, the price shot up to 109,500$ per year.<sup>[[4.5]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/18/this-old-drug-was-free-now-its-109500-a-year/)</sup>
 * "One island, a poor socialist state with infrastructure in grave need of modernisation, has slowly emerged out of the chaos caused by a hurricane’s [Irma] wrath, while the other, a territory of the richest country in the world, cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel."<sup>[[4.6]](http://www.frontline.in/world-affairs/a-tale-of-two-islands/article9892265.ece?homepage=true)</sup>
 * "Almost 90% of edible tomatoes thrown away based on appearance"<sup>[[4.7]](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/13/you-say-tomato-retailers-say-waste-research-finds-produce-problem)</sup>
 * "Republican senator calls health care, food, and shelter a ‘privilege’"<sup>[[4.8]](https://thinkprogress.org/ron-johnson-health-care-a-privilege-1d9fe371b55a/)</sup>
 * In the United States, victims of the Las Vegas shooting in 2017 are required to pay for their own treatments. Many are struggling and going into debt.<sup>[[4.9]](http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/25/pf/insurance/las-vegas-shooting-health-care/index.html)</sup>
 
A quote about jobs and work allocation:
> If you are unemployed, it's not because there isn't any work. Just look around: housing shortages, crime, pollution; we need better schools and parks. Whatever our needs, they all require work, and as long as we have unsatisfied needs, there's work to be done. So ask yourself, what kind of world has work but not jobs? It's a world where work is not related to satisfying our needs, a world where work is only related to satisfying the profit needs of our businesses. This country was not built by the huge corporations or government bureaucracies. It was built by the people who work, and it is the people who should control the work to be done. Yet as long as employment is tied to somebody else's profits, the work won't get done.

**In conclusion**, the list of fundamental flaws of capitalism are as follows:
 * Accumulation of capital that leads to inefficiency, concentration of power, and wealth inequality.
 * Lack of efficiency that hinders innovation.
 * Constant growth that is unsustainable, causes economic crashes, cut corners and encourages the "race to the bottom".
 * Resource allocation within capitalism does not allocate the basics needed to live either at all or sufficiently.
 * Concentration of power that leads to corruption in every level of life, and competition for individual interests instead of societies.
 * Overabundance of product that is wasted.
 * Markets hindering the field of academia due to results and fields not being desirable, i.e. profitable.
 * Unethical practices in order to satisfy the need for infinite growth and profit.

### Class Struggle

### Exploitation

### Imperialism

### Military-Industrial Complex

> Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty miles of concrete pavement. We pay for a single fighter with a half-million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people. . . . This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.

\- President Dwight D. Eisenhower, 1953-04-16

### False Scarcity

### Individualism

### Profit

Businesses often participate in **unethical business practices** in order to satisfy the fundamental need of capitalism for infinite growth and proit. These include:
 * Predatory pricing: the practice of, often large businessness, pricing products at a loss just to eliminate competition.<sup>[[]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_pricing)</sup>
 * Price gouging, often a product of capitalism due to its nature of being controlled by a few, is the practice of drastically raising the price of necessities, especially during times of duress such as natural disasters. By default, this was a legal practice in much of the world until regulations were enacted to prohibit that. Currently within the United States, 17 states still have no laws against such practice.<sup>[[]](http://consumer.findlaw.com/consumer-transactions/price-gouging-laws-by-state.html)
 * "Private prison threatens to close unless state or federal officials fill up 300 more beds."<sup>[[]](http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/company-plans-to-close-private-estancia-prison-lay-off/article_1ecd4d0e-caa1-5a05-bab2-1a7270729271.html)</sup>
 * Workers are often threatened to work off the clock so that the employer does not have to pay.<sup>[[]](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/19/us/forced-to-work-off-the-clock-some-fight-back.html)</sup>
 * 54 towns and cities within Britain have banned begging.<sup>[[]](https://www.buzzfeed.com/emilydugan/exclusive-there-are-now-54-towns-and-cities-in-britain-that)</sup>
 * Two headlines 24 hours apart:  
  "Ohio coroner's office running out of room because of overdose deaths"<sup>[[]](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/health/ohio-coroner-overdose-deaths-trnd/index.html)</sup>  
  "As opioid deaths rise, pharma firm hikes price of antidote more than six-fold"<sup>[[]](http://www.philly.com/philly/health/Pharma-firm--Opioid-Overdose-Antidote-Then-Raising-The-Price.html)</sup>
 * Incentivisation of cars over public transportation, foreign jobs instead of domestic, have led to carbon footprint levels the world hasn't seen in 650,000 years.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
 * More than 110,000 travelers are stranded around Europe and the Middle East after the UK's Monarch Airlines declared bankruptcy. An estimated 860,000 people have lost future travel bookings.<sup>[[]](http://www.businessinsider.com/british-airline-goes-bankrupt-leaving-travelers-stranded-2017-10)</sup> A last ditch effot to scrape as much money as the corporation could before dissolving entirely at the expense of the consumer.
 * Equifax, a credit reporting agency, was hacked in September 2017. The personal and sensitive information was released on 143 million people, including residents from the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.<sup>[[]](https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/equifax-data-leak-could-involve-143-million-consumers/)</sup> Equifax were made aware of the problem in March of that year, and they learned of the actual breach in July.<sup>[[]](http://money.cnn.com/2017/09/16/technology/equifax-breach-security-hole/index.html)
 * In 2013, the company Yahoo had an attack that affected all three billion of its accounts, releasing names, birth dates, passwords and email. In 2014, it had a second attack affecting 500 million people. Before both attacks, the company consistently pushed back funding on security development, and continued to use a method of hashing passwords with MD5 that had [known vulnerabilities](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2016/01/fatally-weak-md5-function-torpedoes-crypto-protections-in-https-and-ipsec/).<sup>[[]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/technology/yahoo-hack-3-billion-users.html)[[]](http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/23/technology/yahoo-hack-timeline/index.html)[[]](https://www.wired.com/2016/12/yahoo-hack-billion-users/)</sup>
 * Ethicon, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson (pharmaceutical company), re-released a vaginal mesh implant (to get consumers to use a newer version despite minimal changes) without clinical trials. They were brought to court after a woman was "left with a mangled urethra, bladder spasms and continual pelvic pain after an unsuccessful procedure that led to three revision surgeries to remove mesh that had cut into her urethra and migrated to her bladder."<sup>[[]](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/sep/29/revealed-johnson-johnsons-irresponsible-actions-over-vaginal-mesh-implant)</sup>
 * UK company 2 Sisters Food Group was ousted in 2017 after an undercover video surfaced showing workers putting chicken that fell on the floor back onto the production line and altering of chicken's kill dates in order to sell more chicken that otherwise could not have been sold.<sup>[[]](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/nov/03/chicken-safety-scandal-2-sisters-factory-to-resume-production)</sup>
 * Perdue Pharma advertised and convinced doctors and the public that its oxycotin drugs had a low-risk of addiction. They also compiled databases of all prescriptions handed out by doctors and stores and did nothing about sudden and suspicious influxes of prescriptions given out.<sup>[[]](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-washington-opioids/washington-state-sues-oxycontin-maker-purdue-pharma-idUSKCN1C32LM)[[]](http://theweek.com/articles/541564/how-american-opiate-epidemic-started-by-pharmaceutical-company)</sup> In 2016 alone, 64,070 people died from opioid overdoses in the United States - since 2000, millions.<sup>[[]](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/opioids-drug-overdose-killed-more-americans-last-year-than-the-vietnam-war/)[[]](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/02/upshot/fentanyl-drug-overdose-deaths.html)</sup>

 * The Bayer Corporation sold HIV and Hepatitis C contaminated blood products which caused up to 10,000 people in the U.S. alone to contract HIV. After they found out the drug was contaminated, they pulled it off the U.S. market and sold it to countries in Asia and Latin America so they could still make money.<sup>[[]](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/may/23/aids.suzannegoldenberg)</sup>

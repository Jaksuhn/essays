## Prologue

Humans, together, form societies. We help each other. We live by each other's happiness - not by each other's misery. We do not hate, do not despise, do not hurt one another. Together, humanity lives on this vast Earth. Earth is rich with enough resources to provide for every one that lives on it. We have the capabilities of living free and filling lives, but have lost our way.

The soul of man has been tainted, has barraged the world with hate, has caused great misery and bloodshed. Humanity has developed. Created advances, tools, machines - machines that give abundance. But that was not enough. Greed has overcome humanity and left us with an unfillable void of want. We think too much and feel too little. We have created great machines but we have not created a great humanity. We have become smarter and more clever, but we have not become more kind. Without kindness, caring, honestly, loyalty, trust and wiseness, life is devoid of all that is good and left with a violent evil. What good is that world?

From the horses to ships, to locomotives, to the planes in the sky, from radio to phones, to television, to the internet, all have brought humanity closer together on this large world. The nature of these inventions speaks for the cries of brotherhood - for unity of us all. This message has the potential of reaching billions of men, women, and children alike - victims of a system that deprive us, imprison us, torture us.

The misery that plagues us is not the way of the world. It is but another form of greed - the bitterness of a spiteful few who fear a changing world. The power that the spiteful possess is not their own - it is the power of the people - of humanity. Just as that power was taken from us, it can be taken back. Do not give in to those that rule in their own interest - to those that do not care about you, enslave you, tell you what to do, what to think, how to feel. They see you as as a lesser animal and use you as cannon fodder to fuel their own self interests. They do not treat you like what you are - humans. Those men are like the machines we created - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts. Humans are not machines. We are not lesser than any one else. Humans care for each other - that is the cornerstone of societies around this great Earth. You have humanity in your heart.

You, the people, have the power - the power to create not just machines, but happiness. You have the abilities to make this life free and filling, wonderful and beautiful. That power must be used. Let us use that power together - to unite. In the name of democracy, we shall fight for a new world - one where we all prosper, where we are secure in our lives, where every one has a chance, has an opportunity, where the right to live is not decided by those who do not care. Tyrants say these things to us and use it to rise to power. They lie to each and every one of us. They do not fufill that promise, nor did they ever intend to. Tyrants use those promises to free themselves, not the people that helped them. We must fight to fufill that promise. We must free the world of the oppression - to rid the world of separation, of greed, of hate, of intolerance. We must fight for a world of reason and prosperity, a world where advancement leads to the happiness of all people. People of all nations, of all lands, unite!

## Capitalism

Capitalism is the current economic system of the world. It is an economic system by which the means of production, the country's trade and industry, is controlled by private individuals or private corporations instead of either the state or the people. Why is capitalism being framed as **the** issue of the world? The system that we live in is as deep as you can go when you are digging for problems. Inequality is a problem, yes, but what causes that divide? Why is capitalism being framed as the problem and not some other system? Currently capitalism is the system used by the every country in the world. An argument can be made for Cuba, the only country in the world with >50% public industry control, however even that country has caused debates among socialists as to whether it truly can be considered socialist, or at the very least not-capitalist. Has capitalism been working for humanity?

This means that 111 (IMF) or 106 (World Bank) countries are underdeveloped.<sup>[[1.17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(PPP)_per_capita)[[1.18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Factbook_list_of_developed_countries)</sup>

### Fundamentals
These are problems that are innate to capitalism itself. They cannot be fixed (either completely or at all).

**Accumulation of capital** is the basis of capitalism. Examples within our society include rent, interest, profit, royalties, or capital gains.<sup>[[2.1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_accumulation)</sup> Now, why is this bad? Capitalism is inherently an **everexpanding system**. This means that they must continue to accumulate capital if they wish to remain capitalists, for if they did not they would lose to competitors. Eventually you reach a level of worker and land exploitation in your own country that is not sustainable, so you expand operations around the globe.<sup>[[2.2]](http://rbutler.sdsu.edu/gurely2.htm)</sup> The need for capital accumulation often leads to the generation of wasteful industries that solely exist for profit.<sup>[[2.3]](https://monthlyreview.org/2009/11/01/what-needs-to-be-done-a-socialist-view)[[2.4]](https://web.archive.org/web/20100716140329/http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/may10/page23.html)</sup> A final note about the effects of accumulation of capital is the creation of non-productive industries that serve to further capital accumulation and nothing else. The most notable example of this being the financial industry, which is one of the leading causes of financial bubbles, which ultimately lead to economic downturns at best and economic depressions at worst.<sup>[[2.5]](https://web.archive.org/web/20140228090631/http://www.rdwolff.com/content/economic-crisis-socialist-perspective)[[2.6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929)[[2.7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970s_energy_crisis)[[2.8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_1980s_recession)[[2.9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_1990s_recession)[[2.10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble)[[2.11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007–2008)[[2.12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_debt_crisis)</sup>

Another core property of capitalism is competition. Many capitalists believe this to be a fundamental right of humans - to be able to go out freely and innovate and compete with others within society.<sup>[[3.1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism)[[3.2]](http://capitalism.org/category/competition/)</sup> The fundamental flaw of competition, however, is its **lack of efficiency** for innovation and creation. Instead of having the best minds grouped together and cooperate to innovate and create, you have them competing against each other.<sup>[[3.3]](http://www.charleswarner.us/articles/competit.htm)[[3.4]](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/235229)[[3.5]](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/compete_or_cooperate)</sup> One product of the competition market are patents/copyrights. These laws have been shown to decrease innovation.<sup>[[3.6]](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/496/transcript)[[3.7]](http://www.edegan.com/wiki/images/8/88/Heller_Eisenberg_%281998%29_-_Can_Patents_Deter_Innovation_The_Anticommons_In_Biomedical_Research.pdf)</sup> Instead of the patent system being used to *temporarily* provide the inventor with some guaranteed return on investment, the system has been abused and changed, the most notable example being the corporation Disney lobbying the United States' Congress to extend the length of copyright protection in order to prevent their animated character "Mickey Mouse" from entering public domain.<sup>[[3.8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act)</sup>

The exact statistics on **poor resource allocation** for basics such as homes, food and water were talked about in the [Capitalism](#capitalism) section, so this section will show other examples of improper resource allocation *specifically* because of it's unprofitability.

 * Cities within the United States make it illegal or heavily restricted to donate and feed homeless people.<sup>[[4.2]](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2014/10/22/357846415/more-cities-are-making-it-illegal-to-hand-out-food-to-the-homeless)</sup>
 * "Shane Patrick Boyle, a founder of Zine Fest Houston, died on March 18 after his GoFundMe campaign to pay for insulin came up $50 short."<sup>[[4.3]](https://www.thenation.com/article/alex-azar-trumps-hhs-pick-has-already-been-a-disaster-for-people-with-diabetes/)</sup>
 * Pfizer halts research into alzheimer's and parkinson's treatments due to unprofitability.<sup>[[4.4]](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/01/08/576443442/pfizer-halts-research-efforts-into-alzheimers-and-parkinsons-treatments)</sup>
 * Daranide, a disease used to treat eye disease glaucoma, used to cost nothing. After being acquired by the company Strongbridge Biopharma, the price shot up to 109,500$ per year.<sup>[[4.5]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/12/18/this-old-drug-was-free-now-its-109500-a-year/)</sup>
 * "One island, a poor socialist state with infrastructure in grave need of modernisation, has slowly emerged out of the chaos caused by a hurricane’s [Irma] wrath, while the other, a territory of the richest country in the world, cannot see the light at the end of the tunnel."<sup>[[4.6]](http://www.frontline.in/world-affairs/a-tale-of-two-islands/article9892265.ece?homepage=true)</sup>
 * "Almost 90% of edible tomatoes thrown away based on appearance"<sup>[[4.7]](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/13/you-say-tomato-retailers-say-waste-research-finds-produce-problem)</sup>
 * "Republican senator calls health care, food, and shelter a ‘privilege’"<sup>[[4.8]](https://thinkprogress.org/ron-johnson-health-care-a-privilege-1d9fe371b55a/)</sup>
 * In the United States, victims of the Las Vegas shooting in 2017 are required to pay for their own treatments. Many are struggling and going into debt.<sup>[[4.9]](http://money.cnn.com/2017/10/25/pf/insurance/las-vegas-shooting-health-care/index.html)</sup>
 
A quote about jobs and work allocation:
> If you are unemployed, it's not because there isn't any work. Just look around: housing shortages, crime, pollution; we need better schools and parks. Whatever our needs, they all require work, and as long as we have unsatisfied needs, there's work to be done. So ask yourself, what kind of world has work but not jobs? It's a world where work is not related to satisfying our needs, a world where work is only related to satisfying the profit needs of our businesses. This country was not built by the huge corporations or government bureaucracies. It was built by the people who work, and it is the people who should control the work to be done. Yet as long as employment is tied to somebody else's profits, the work won't get done.

Capitalism fundamentally **concentrates wealth** to the hands of fewer and fewer people at the top, and given that wealth directly correlates to power, class divide and inequality is guaranteed.<sup>[[5.1]](http://evonomics.com/perfect-markets-concentrate-wealth-strangle-growth-prosperity/)</sup> Those who hold wealth have the means to invest in newly created sources and structures of wealth, or to otherwise leverage the accumulation of wealth, and are thus the beneficiaries of even greater wealth. Corporations with enough capital have direct power of those below them and are able to become even larger by out-competing smaller businesses by changing laws, industry control, and/or predatory pricing, as mentioned earlier.<sup>[[5.2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_accumulation)[[5.3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_concentration)[[5.4]](http://www.economictheories.org/2008/07/karl-marx-concentration-and.html)[[5.5]](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-wealth-reduces-compassion/)</sup>

**Academic capitalism**, or capitalism involvement in academia, has a wide variety of issues that will be addressed here. Firstly, the role of education changes. Instead of focusing on providing knowledge to society in order to further it, the focus has shifted towards profit. This has lead to astronomical administration costs at the expense of teacher pay and benefits<sup>[[6.1]](https://stateimpact.npr.org/florida/maps/mapping-florida-school-district-administrative-costs/)[[6.2]](https://stateimpact.npr.org/florida/2012/05/02/what-administrative-costs-say-about-school-district-spending/)[[6.3]](http://www.news-journalonline.com/news/20130601/schools-try-to-hold-the-line-on-school-administrative-costs)</sup>, abuse of tax-exemptions<sup>[[6.4]](http://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/tax_yale/)</sup>, reduction of scientific progress and an increase in unethical practices.<sup>[[6.5]](http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/ees.2016.0223)[[6.6]](http://www.nature.com/news/corporate-culture-has-no-place-in-academia-1.20724)</sup>

**In conclusion**, the list of fundamental flaws of capitalism are as follows:
 * Accumulation of capital that leads to inefficiency, concentration of power, and wealth inequality.
 * Lack of efficiency that hinders innovation.
 * Constant growth that is unsustainable, causes economic crashes, cut corners and encourages the "race to the bottom".
 * Resource allocation within capitalism does not allocate the basics needed to live either at all or sufficiently.
 * Concentration of power that leads to corruption in every level of life, and competition for individual interests instead of societies.
 * Overabundance of product that is wasted. See **Resource allocation** and [Capitalism](#capitalism) sections.
 * Markets hindering the field of academia due to results and fields not being desirable, i.e. profitable.
 * Unethical practices in order to satisfy the need for infinite growth and profit. See [Profit](#profit).
 
### Class Struggle

Class struggle, put simply, is the relationship between the classes in capitalism. The [bourgeoisie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourgeoisie#Marxist_theory), the capitalist ruling class, pay the [proletariat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proletariat), the working class, a wage which is a fraction of the profit produced from the value of their labour. The struggle is the inability of the working class to dictate what is created, what is done with profits, how the working conditions are, etc, since it is the bourgeoisie that has all the control over the proletariat. This is where the critique of capitalism, socialism, came in. Under socialism, private property, that is the [means of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production) (not to be confused with [personal property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_property#Personal_versus_private_property)), is operated democratically by the workers. The workers are both the working class and the operator class under this system, the idea being that if workers were to be united democratically, the imbalance of power, income inequality, outsourcing (globalisation), and pollution would effectively stop, since workers would not want each other suffering, would not want their jobs lost to places abroad, would not want their local communities to be poisoned by pollution.<sup>[[7.1]](https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/en/slaughte.htm)[[7.2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_conflict)</sup> One of the biggest arguments against capitalism is the misallocation of productivity gains. Under capitalism, the goal of innovation is to increase profit for the capitalist rather than decrease time worked for the employee, this results in all the gains of productivity going to the top, and no benefit to the employee except for a marginal decrease in the cost of a certain commodity. This can also result in overproduction, an inefficient use of resources.

Other forms of class struggles within capitalism would be the struggle between races, and the working class under one nation versus the working class of another nation. Racial tensions and foreign tensions, while not solely related to capitalism itself, is a byproduct of one of the fundamental flaws within capitalism - infinite growth.<sup>[[8.1]](http://workerssocialistparty.co.za/class-and-race/)[[8.2]](https://web.archive.org/web/20170704053018/http://academic.evergreen.edu/b/bohmerp/marxracism.htm)</sup> Capitalism repurposed race and racism. By dividing human beings, conceptually and practically, into intrinsically different subgroups, capitalism's defenders could explain and justify why its economic benefits (e.g. the status of employer rather than employee) and burdens (unemployment, poverty etc.) were so unequally distributed (both within countries and globally). Employers, politicians, academics and journalists reinforced the notion that the cause, fault or blame for that unequal distribution lay with racially differentiated characteristics, not with the capitalist system.<sup>[[8.3]](http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/35804-how-capitalism-and-racism-support-each-other)</sup> This exact same scenario has been applied to foreigners, resulting in rising tensions among native populations and immigrants.<sup>[[8.4]](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33700624)[[8.5]](http://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/timeline/riseind/immgnts/)[[8.6]](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/16/france-racism-immigration-sarkozy)[[8.7]](http://davidcard.berkeley.edu/papers/euroimmig.pdf)</sup> Capitalism's inherent need to globalise into new markets creates an influx of lost native jobs in favour of outsourcing, and lost societal benefits in its native countries by taking wealth out of one country and moving it abroad.

### Exploitation

Exploitation of labour is the act of treating ones workers unfairly for ones own benefit. It is a social relationship based on a fundamental asymmetry in a power relationship between workers and their employers. To understand its relation to capitalism, you must think of profit. What is profit? Profit is the difference between what you pay your workers, infrastructure and materials and the money you get by selling that which was made with the workers and materials you bought.<sup>[[9.1]](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/profit)</sup> In a capitalist society, those that attain the greatest profits are the ones that survive. Because it is safe to assume that the costs of materials and infrastructure are covered in the price of a commodity, profit is labour that is not paid to the worker. So, all of that being said, by nature of the system itself, capitalism exploits those who are without capital and required to sell their own labour to live, for they do not get all of the fruits of their labour.

"From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" is a phrase popularised (though not invented) by Karl Marx, meaning that each person works for society to the best of their ability, and that everyone is to have no unsatisfied needs.<sup>[[9.2]](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch01.htm)</sup> A similar phrase, "to each according to his contribution", was also popularised by the socialist and labour movements.<sup>[[9.3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_each_according_to_his_contribution)</sup> Both of these slogans were integral parts of labour movements from the 19<sup>th</sup> century onward.

### Imperialism

Capitalism is inherently imperialistic because it must expand. Surplus production leads to the pursuit of new markets to maintain profits as the old markets become saturated, or if labour in the current market becomes too expensive, or if there are no longer any natural resources available in the current market. Eventually this leads to a global market.<sup>[[]](https://www.thoughtco.com/globalization-of-capitalism-3026076)</sup>

### Military-Industrial Complex

> Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty miles of concrete pavement. We pay for a single fighter with a half-million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people. . . . This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.

\- President Dwight D. Eisenhower, [1953-04-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chance_for_Peace_speech)

### False Scarcity

### Individualism

### Profit

Businesses often participate in **unethical business practices** in order to satisfy the fundamental need of capitalism for infinite growth and proit. These include:
 * Predatory pricing: the practice of, often large businessness, pricing products at a loss just to eliminate competition.<sup>[[]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_pricing)</sup>
 * Price gouging, often a product of capitalism due to its nature of being controlled by a few, is the practice of drastically raising the price of necessities, especially during times of duress such as natural disasters. By default, this was a legal practice in much of the world until regulations were enacted to prohibit that. Currently within the United States, 17 states still have no laws against such practice.<sup>[[]](http://consumer.findlaw.com/consumer-transactions/price-gouging-laws-by-state.html)
 * "Private prison threatens to close unless state or federal officials fill up 300 more beds."<sup>[[]](http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/company-plans-to-close-private-estancia-prison-lay-off/article_1ecd4d0e-caa1-5a05-bab2-1a7270729271.html)</sup>
 * Workers are often threatened to work off the clock so that the employer does not have to pay.<sup>[[]](http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/19/us/forced-to-work-off-the-clock-some-fight-back.html)</sup>
 * 54 towns and cities within Britain have banned begging.<sup>[[]](https://www.buzzfeed.com/emilydugan/exclusive-there-are-now-54-towns-and-cities-in-britain-that)</sup>
 * Two headlines 24 hours apart:  
  "Ohio coroner's office running out of room because of overdose deaths"<sup>[[]](http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/01/health/ohio-coroner-overdose-deaths-trnd/index.html)</sup>  
  "As opioid deaths rise, pharma firm hikes price of antidote more than six-fold"<sup>[[]](http://www.philly.com/philly/health/Pharma-firm--Opioid-Overdose-Antidote-Then-Raising-The-Price.html)</sup>
 * Incentivisation of cars over public transportation, foreign jobs instead of domestic, have led to carbon footprint levels the world hasn't seen in 650,000 years.<sup>[[]](https://www.vox.com/2015/8/10/9118199/public-transportation-subway-buses)[[]](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-robbins/what-ever-happened-to-pub_b_633585.html)[[]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy)[[]](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/may/13/carbonemissions.climatechange)</sup>
 * More than 110,000 travelers are stranded around Europe and the Middle East after the UK's Monarch Airlines declared bankruptcy. An estimated 860,000 people have lost future travel bookings.<sup>[[]](http://www.businessinsider.com/british-airline-goes-bankrupt-leaving-travelers-stranded-2017-10)</sup> A last ditch effot to scrape as much money as the corporation could before dissolving entirely at the expense of the consumer.
 * Equifax, a credit reporting agency, was hacked in September 2017. The personal and sensitive information was released on 143 million people, including residents from the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.<sup>[[]](https://techcrunch.com/2017/09/07/equifax-data-leak-could-involve-143-million-consumers/)</sup> Equifax were made aware of the problem in March of that year, and they learned of the actual breach in July.<sup>[[]](http://money.cnn.com/2017/09/16/technology/equifax-breach-security-hole/index.html)

### Why Socialism?

In May 1949, a brief article written by Albert Einstein titled "[Why Socialism?](https://monthlyreview.org/2009/05/01/why-socialism/)" was published in the journal *Monthly Review*. It reads as follows.

> Is it advisable for one who is not an expert on economic and social issues to express views on the subject of socialism? I believe for a number of reasons that it is.

> Let us first consider the question from the point of view of scientific knowledge. It might appear that there are no essential methodological differences between astronomy and economics: scientists in both fields attempt to discover laws of general acceptability for a circumscribed group of phenomena in order to make the interconnection of these phenomena as clearly understandable as possible. But in reality such methodological differences do exist. The discovery of general laws in the field of economics is made difficult by the circumstance that observed economic phenomena are often affected by many factors which are very hard to evaluate separately. In addition, the experience which has accumulated since the beginning of the so-called civilized period of human history has—as is well known—been largely influenced and limited by causes which are by no means exclusively economic in nature. For example, most of the major states of history owed their existence to conquest. The conquering peoples established themselves, legally and economically, as the privileged class of the conquered country. They seized for themselves a monopoly of the land ownership and appointed a priesthood from among their own ranks. The priests, in control of education, made the class division of society into a permanent institution and created a system of values by which the people were thenceforth, to a large extent unconsciously, guided in their social behavior.

> But historic tradition is, so to speak, of yesterday; nowhere have we really overcome what Thorstein Veblen called “the predatory phase” of human development. The observable economic facts belong to that phase and even such laws as we can derive from them are not applicable to other phases. Since the real purpose of socialism is precisely to overcome and advance beyond the predatory phase of human development, economic science in its present state can throw little light on the socialist society of the future.

> Second, socialism is directed towards a social-ethical end. Science, however, cannot create ends and, even less, instill them in human beings; science, at most, can supply the means by which to attain certain ends. But the ends themselves are conceived by personalities with lofty ethical ideals and—if these ends are not stillborn, but vital and vigorous—are adopted and carried forward by those many human beings who, half unconsciously, determine the slow evolution of society.

> For these reasons, we should be on our guard not to overestimate science and scientific methods when it is a question of human problems; and we should not assume that experts are the only ones who have a right to express themselves on questions affecting the organization of society.

> Innumerable voices have been asserting for some time now that human society is passing through a crisis, that its stability has been gravely shattered. It is characteristic of such a situation that individuals feel indifferent or even hostile toward the group, small or large, to which they belong. In order to illustrate my meaning, let me record here a personal experience. I recently discussed with an intelligent and well-disposed man the threat of another war, which in my opinion would seriously endanger the existence of mankind, and I remarked that only a supra-national organization would offer protection from that danger. Thereupon my visitor, very calmly and coolly, said to me: “Why are you so deeply opposed to the disappearance of the human race?”

> I am sure that as little as a century ago no one would have so lightly made a statement of this kind. It is the statement of a man who has striven in vain to attain an equilibrium within himself and has more or less lost hope of succeeding. It is the expression of a painful solitude and isolation from which so many people are suffering in these days. What is the cause? Is there a way out?

> It is easy to raise such questions, but difficult to answer them with any degree of assurance. I must try, however, as best I can, although I am very conscious of the fact that our feelings and strivings are often contradictory and obscure and that they cannot be expressed in easy and simple formulas.

> Man is, at one and the same time, a solitary being and a social being. As a solitary being, he attempts to protect his own existence and that of those who are closest to him, to satisfy his personal desires, and to develop his innate abilities. As a social being, he seeks to gain the recognition and affection of his fellow human beings, to share in their pleasures, to comfort them in their sorrows, and to improve their conditions of life. Only the existence of these varied, frequently conflicting, strivings accounts for the special character of a man, and their specific combination determines the extent to which an individual can achieve an inner equilibrium and can contribute to the well-being of society. It is quite possible that the relative strength of these two drives is, in the main, fixed by inheritance. But the personality that finally emerges is largely formed by the environment in which a man happens to find himself during his development, by the structure of the society in which he grows up, by the tradition of that society, and by its appraisal of particular types of behavior. The abstract concept “society” means to the individual human being the sum total of his direct and indirect relations to his contemporaries and to all the people of earlier generations. The individual is able to think, feel, strive, and work by himself; but he depends so much upon society—in his physical, intellectual, and emotional existence—that it is impossible to think of him, or to understand him, outside the framework of society. It is “society” which provides man with food, clothing, a home, the tools of work, language, the forms of thought, and most of the content of thought; his life is made possible through the labor and the accomplishments of the many millions past and present who are all hidden behind the small word “society.”

> It is evident, therefore, that the dependence of the individual upon society is a fact of nature which cannot be abolished—just as in the case of ants and bees. However, while the whole life process of ants and bees is fixed down to the smallest detail by rigid, hereditary instincts, the social pattern and interrelationships of human beings are very variable and susceptible to change. Memory, the capacity to make new combinations, the gift of oral communication have made possible developments among human being which are not dictated by biological necessities. Such developments manifest themselves in traditions, institutions, and organizations; in literature; in scientific and engineering accomplishments; in works of art. This explains how it happens that, in a certain sense, man can influence his life through his own conduct, and that in this process conscious thinking and wanting can play a part.

> Man acquires at birth, through heredity, a biological constitution which we must consider fixed and unalterable, including the natural urges which are characteristic of the human species. In addition, during his lifetime, he acquires a cultural constitution which he adopts from society through communication and through many other types of influences. It is this cultural constitution which, with the passage of time, is subject to change and which determines to a very large extent the relationship between the individual and society. Modern anthropology has taught us, through comparative investigation of so-called primitive cultures, that the social behavior of human beings may differ greatly, depending upon prevailing cultural patterns and the types of organization which predominate in society. It is on this that those who are striving to improve the lot of man may ground their hopes: human beings are not condemned, because of their biological constitution, to annihilate each other or to be at the mercy of a cruel, self-inflicted fate.

> If we ask ourselves how the structure of society and the cultural attitude of man should be changed in order to make human life as satisfying as possible, we should constantly be conscious of the fact that there are certain conditions which we are unable to modify. As mentioned before, the biological nature of man is, for all practical purposes, not subject to change. Furthermore, technological and demographic developments of the last few centuries have created conditions which are here to stay. In relatively densely settled populations with the goods which are indispensable to their continued existence, an extreme division of labor and a highly-centralized productive apparatus are absolutely necessary. The time—which, looking back, seems so idyllic—is gone forever when individuals or relatively small groups could be completely self-sufficient. It is only a slight exaggeration to say that mankind constitutes even now a planetary community of production and consumption.

> I have now reached the point where I may indicate briefly what to me constitutes the essence of the crisis of our time. It concerns the relationship of the individual to society. The individual has become more conscious than ever of his dependence upon society. But he does not experience this dependence as a positive asset, as an organic tie, as a protective force, but rather as a threat to his natural rights, or even to his economic existence. Moreover, his position in society is such that the egotistical drives of his make-up are constantly being accentuated, while his social drives, which are by nature weaker, progressively deteriorate. All human beings, whatever their position in society, are suffering from this process of deterioration. Unknowingly prisoners of their own egotism, they feel insecure, lonely, and deprived of the naive, simple, and unsophisticated enjoyment of life. Man can find meaning in life, short and perilous as it is, only through devoting himself to society.

> The economic anarchy of capitalist society as it exists today is, in my opinion, the real source of the evil. We see before us a huge community of producers the members of which are unceasingly striving to deprive each other of the fruits of their collective labor—not by force, but on the whole in faithful compliance with legally established rules. In this respect, it is important to realize that the means of production—that is to say, the entire productive capacity that is needed for producing consumer goods as well as additional capital goods—may legally be, and for the most part are, the private property of individuals.

> For the sake of simplicity, in the discussion that follows I shall call “workers” all those who do not share in the ownership of the means of production—although this does not quite correspond to the customary use of the term. The owner of the means of production is in a position to purchase the labor power of the worker. By using the means of production, the worker produces new goods which become the property of the capitalist. The essential point about this process is the relation between what the worker produces and what he is paid, both measured in terms of real value. Insofar as the labor contract is “free,” what the worker receives is determined not by the real value of the goods he produces, but by his minimum needs and by the capitalists’ requirements for labor power in relation to the number of workers competing for jobs. It is important to understand that even in theory the payment of the worker is not determined by the value of his product.

> Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.

> The situation prevailing in an economy based on the private ownership of capital is thus characterized by two main principles: first, means of production (capital) are privately owned and the owners dispose of them as they see fit; second, the labor contract is free. Of course, there is no such thing as a pure capitalist society in this sense. In particular, it should be noted that the workers, through long and bitter political struggles, have succeeded in securing a somewhat improved form of the “free labor contract” for certain categories of workers. But taken as a whole, the present day economy does not differ much from “pure” capitalism.

> Production is carried on for profit, not for use. There is no provision that all those able and willing to work will always be in a position to find employment; an “army of unemployed” almost always exists. The worker is constantly in fear of losing his job. Since unemployed and poorly paid workers do not provide a profitable market, the production of consumers’ goods is restricted, and great hardship is the consequence. Technological progress frequently results in more unemployment rather than in an easing of the burden of work for all. The profit motive, in conjunction with competition among capitalists, is responsible for an instability in the accumulation and utilization of capital which leads to increasingly severe depressions. Unlimited competition leads to a huge waste of labor, and to that crippling of the social consciousness of individuals which I mentioned before.

> This crippling of individuals I consider the worst evil of capitalism. Our whole educational system suffers from this evil. An exaggerated competitive attitude is inculcated into the student, who is trained to worship acquisitive success as a preparation for his future career.

> I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman, and child. The education of the individual, in addition to promoting his own innate abilities, would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society.

> Nevertheless, it is necessary to remember that a planned economy is not yet socialism. A planned economy as such may be accompanied by the complete enslavement of the individual. The achievement of socialism requires the solution of some extremely difficult socio-political problems: how is it possible, in view of the far-reaching centralization of political and economic power, to prevent bureaucracy from becoming all-powerful and overweening? How can the rights of the individual be protected and therewith a democratic counterweight to the power of bureaucracy be assured?

> Clarity about the aims and problems of socialism is of greatest significance in our age of transition. Since, under present circumstances, free and unhindered discussion of these problems has come under a powerful taboo, I consider the foundation of this magazine to be an important public service.

### Types of Socialism

*This section will essentially be a simplification of the wikipedia article "[Types of socialism]"(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Types_of_socialism) with little additions of historical context. For a more in-depth understanding, please refer to the wiki.*

Defining socialism is very often a difficult topic that ends up with much argument between socialists and even outsiders. Nonetheless, every form of socialism is based off the idea that workers must control the [means of production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Means_of_production). On its own, socialism is purely an economic system - it does not dictate how a state, if it exists, should operate. Some flavours of socialism do address this within their ideology.

**The Debated and/or Non-Socialisms**

The systems in this category are either: not socialist at all, but confused with socialism; considered to be socialism among some but not among others; support a partial socialist implementation but ultimately retain parts of capitalism.

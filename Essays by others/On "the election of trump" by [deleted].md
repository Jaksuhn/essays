German here, sometimes it might be useful to get an outside opinion, but take it with a grain of salt, as I am less familiar with your institutions than a native. 

I think what is currently happening in the US is terrible, and will have a long-lasting, negative effect on your democracy. Trump's rethorics have seriously lowered the quality of public discourse, and it is further removed from reality today than at any time in the last 40 years. Basically, both sides cry "fake news" all the time, and aren't willing to listen to the other side anymore. Though it needs to be said that the Republicans are *much more* guilty of this.

Trump is spearheading the alt-right, and I wouldn't classify all of them as neo-fascist, but certainly a big portion of them. The rest are a weird collection of libertarians, conspiracy theorists, racists and religious nuts. They are currently succesfully building an alliance that might outlive Trump and significantly change the republican party in the process. Fascism was always really good at adapting and incorporating ideologies to get a plurality of supporters. One quick example for this would be how Nazism was occultist and proletarian, while spanish fascism was deeply catholic and monarchist. From a purely academic point of view it might not even make sense to call any axis country besides Italy fascist, as their systems were very different afterall.

Now this all wouldn't be too bad of a problem if the voting process was proportional, but as it stands right now, the alt-right might even be able to dominate american politics for the next five years, and in this time it will further divide the country, damage the US's reputation and install loyal people in key positions.

The US isn't immune to fascism, it is just more difficult to install there than in other, more homogenous countries. The way most Americans cope with it at the moment though - by writing sarcastic posts on twitter or simply ignoring the matter - doesn't really give me confidence in your future.

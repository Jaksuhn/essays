We know powerful Russians have close ties to the NRA and are being investigated for funneling millions into the organization. This influx of money from Russia is being investigated by FBI Counterintelligence as the NRA's campaign contributions during this Presidental election doubled previous campaigns.^[[1]](http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article195231139.html) It was at an NRA convention where it was planned that the Trump campaign meet with Alexander Torshin, an ally of Vladimir Putin, a reputed mobster and deputy governor of the Russian central bank.^[[2]](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-jr-met-with-man-with-close-ties-to-kremlin/?ftag=CNM-00-10aab7e&linkId=44949927) Alexander Torshin is wanted in Spain in connection to a money laundering operation for a Russian crime syndicate.^[[3]](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-08-09/mobster-or-central-banker-spanish-cops-allege-this-russian-both) Alexander Torshin reportedly told a Trump campaign adviser that he could arrange a back-channel meeting between President Trump and President Putin.^[[4]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/03/us/politics/trump-putin-russia-nra-campaign.html) The House Intelligence Committee testimony of Fusion GPS CEO Glen Simpson was released, in it he testifies that Russia had infiltrated the NRA and other conservative groups.^[[5]](http://docs.house.gov/meetings/IG/IG00/20180118/106796/HMTG-115-IG00-20180118-SD002.pdf)


**Pg. 142 - 144 House Intelligence Committee Testimony**

>MS. SPEIER: Okay. What is the interest of Russia with the National Rifle Association?

>MR. SIMPSON: I think that most of what we have found is pretty much out there now. You know, it's been said by others, but, you know, what eventually - it appears the Russians, you know, infiltrated the NRA And there is more than one explanation for why. But I would say broadly speaking, it appears that the Russian operation was designed to infiltrate conservative organizations. And they targeted various conservative organizations, religious and otherwise, and they seem to have made a very concerted effort to get in with the NRA. And so there is a Russian banker-slash-Duma member-slash-Mafia leader named Alexander Torshin who is a life member of the NRA. And we spent a lot of time investigating Mr. Torshin. And he is well known to Spanish law enforcement for money laundering activity, and you have probably seen the press articles. And I think the Spanish files on him should be available to you.And he, as you know, was supposed to have a meeting with President Trump after the inauguration. And somebody noticed that there had been some stories about him that weren't pretty good. So he is one of the more important figures, but, you know, another woman with whom he was working, Maria Butina, also was a big Trump fan in Russia, and then suddenly showed up here and started hanging around the Trump transition after the election and rented an apartment and enrolled herself at AU, which I assume gets you a visa.

>MS. SPEIER: You said there were other conservative groups. Are there other conservative groups in the United States that they have infiltrated to your knowledge?

>MR. SIMPSON: I think there's been -we have done some research on some religious groups having relationships w ith the Russians, having, developing, and pursuing relationships with various religious groups. The names of them escape my mind. But there has been a lot of that. And then there has been the independence movements, California independence, Texas independence. You know, it's a big operation.



**I believe that the Russians have taken advantage of Citizen's United. Citizen's United ties into the Republican party as well as the Trump Campaign. Please allow me to explain in 2 comments below. Its an extensive read, however I believe it is important in understanding who is involved and how the last election played out.**

We've been wondering for a while, why has the Republican party been complicit in attempting to cover up Russian election interference? It seems like the Russian government used intermediaries to funnel millions of dollars into Republican campaigns.^[[6]](https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2017/12/15/putins-proxies-helped-funnel-millions-gop-campaigns) The Russian government has taken advantage of the 2010 Citizens United decision and used oligarchs to fund GOP candidates and their campaigns.^[[7]](https://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/commentary/2017/08/03/tangled-web-connects-russian-oligarch-money-gop-campaigns) These are opinion pieces, nonetheless they are an interesting read and it may have the answers to some of our questions. 


Now why do I mention this? Well remember that Senate Judiciary Fusion GPS testimony that Republicans refused to release? Glenn Simpson's answers lay credence to this theory. I think pages 151 through 153 in particular are important, it alludes to the fact that the Russians knew they could befriend members of the GOP through Paul Manafort acting as a laison for Oligarchs used as intermediaries almost a decade ago. Although Senator McCain did not take any donations from Oleg Deripaska (the oligarch with close ties to Paul Manafort), it is obvious that they were attempting to see who would be receptive of their aid^[[8]](https://www.feinstein.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/3/9/3974a291-ddbe-4525-9ed1-22bab43c05ae/934A3562824CACA7BB4D915E97709D2F.simpson-transcript-redacted.pdf) Something we know they pursued and acted upon in the 2016 election.

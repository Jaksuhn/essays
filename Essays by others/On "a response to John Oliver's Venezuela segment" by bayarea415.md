I just seen John Oliver's Segment on Venezuela, and was hoping for some vindication regarding its protest and US involvement. But the exact opposite was true. I was quite surprised because John Oliver does do his research and investigations. [This portion upsetted me the most when John attempted to brush aside "some coup attempts in the 60s and 70s in only 3 Latin American Countries"](https://youtu.be/IYfgvS0FA7U?t=14m7s). We all know that the US and CIA obviously did a lot more in Central and South America. 

But to even take this a step further and say that the US has absolutely no involvement what so ever is absolutely ridiculous and false. 

But first, I don't want to get into whether Venezuela is truly socialist. The fact of the matter is, their steps towards dictating their own future, Hugo Chavez, and the important attempts they are taking is in the interest of any socialist, and false attacks by imperialistic propaganda ought to be refuted.

The fact of the matter is there is evidence that Maduro turning down medical aid is because of Western NGOs are attempting to unfairly influence the opposition through funneling financial support. Why? For oil:

[And the fact that the US secretary of state was an Ex-Exxon CEO, and clearly does not have any conflict of interest when it came to Venezuela nationalizing their oil reserves for the people. /s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Tillerson)

This is why John Oliver's segment is so upsetting. It claims that the US has "nothing to do with Venezuela" when there is clear, unbiased evidence that there is (Yes, beyond the documents I posted, there are two articles that come from "bias" sources, but I ask the please look at the information and sources they've analyzed, since they actually took the time to investigate these sources, and I found them to be reliable despite their bias). But even if you do not accept the articles, the documents are crystal clear that Maduro is right; there is US involvement and interest that they want to destabilize Venezuela for access to its oil. 

If John Oliver really wants to keep the integrity of his show, I ask him (or someone to contact him) and point out this information (and so much more) regarding Venezuela. This segment was sham and propaganda that does not show the true nature of what Venezuela is about. Maybe someone can reach @Telsur or something for a rebuttal segment?

Hi, german here. 

This is all part of the Idea of "Innocent until proven guilty" and the realization that a premature reporting before the conclusion of the trial may lead to undue tensions and may sacrifice the accused on the altar of publicity without any actual wrongdoing.  

A good example of how badly this can turn out is the case of the [central park five](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park_jogger_case) in which were actually falsely convicted and jailed while being innocent. The reporting was skewed to the point that these people were and still are actually viewed as guilty by many (including a sitting president) while having been proven innocent. 

And while it is within the realm of the possible that the murder of the holocaust surviving tough old lady was committed because of antisemitism it would be premature to announce any identifying information on the suspects before the trial or even the investigation is concluded. 

It may seem "clear" to you that it 'was them black Muslims' which may still turn out to be true. But in the mean while I implore you to let law enforcement and the courts do their job. Let them get to the bottom of it all and then let's view this heinous crime as something committed by an individual or individuals. Let us calmly and without prejudice examine the motives and then as a united Europe take steps to eliminate the motivations for such crimes. 

We fight jealousy by creating equality. We fight hate by creating better understanding and we create unity by reaching over our racial and religious divides. 

Prematurely accusing anyone in any forum does not serve any purpose except dividing us. Let's quell our lust for sensationalism for the moment and stick to the facts. 

Sincerely, 
A European.

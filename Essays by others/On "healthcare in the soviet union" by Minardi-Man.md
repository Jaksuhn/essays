This is an interesting question. 

I will start off by noting that, in most regards, it really is not particularly fair to compare the quality and availability of healthcare in the Soviet Union to the industrialized nations in the West, like the United States, and especially Western Europe or Canada. No matter what Soviet leadership said, the USSR never managed to equal (or even come close to) their Cold War adversaries in terms of economic development, with the projected GPD per capita hovering somewhere south of the $10.000 mark around 1990, less than half that of the United States, although precise figures are practically impossible to come by due to the various distortions, not least of which was the presence of a sprawling shadow economy. 

With that being said, and to give you a general answer, the Soviet healthcare system, when seen in the context of the country's overall economic development, was surprisingly well developed but only if one considers its limitations. It was remarked by some Western observers that the Soviet Union is the most developed of all the underdeveloped countries in the world, and I think it rings true in regards to its healthcare system. 

First of all, some very brief historic background. 

Prior to the Revolution of 1917 Russian healthcare system was virtually non-existent in the sense that its systematized provision to the vast majority of the population outside of a few urban centres, was virtually non-existent. If you were living in rural areas, you'd be extremely lucky to have access to a trained doctor - most of the services in those places were provided either by people with no formal training (or very little), or members of the clergy. Even though the medical science was starting to take off by the early 20th century, producing several esteemed specialists, it was both behind the levels of Western Europe and North America, and was very limited in its scope and practical effect on the health of the majority of the population. 

With the establishment of the Soviet Union, the state started the creation of completely socialized healthcare system. At its core, it was a centralized system with the government providing state-funded health care to all citizens (at first it was to all *employed* citizens). The right to health was officially enshrined in the Soviet constitution, making Soviet Union one of the first countries that promised universal free cradle to grave healthcare coverage, sometimes called the Semashenko system (after Nikolai Semashenko, one of its creators). The system was tiered around the district health board and the district physician. Accordingly, all health personnel on all levels were employed by the state.


In the first three or four decades of Soviet rule this system was indeed a major improvement over what was previously available, leading to drastic decreases in infant mortality and increases in life expectancy (though this is largely masked by the destructive effects of the Second World War and the preceding famine), as well as decreases in the rates of various infectious diseases, such as cholera, typhus, and tuberculosis. 


The Soviet government generally understood the complexity of the tasks that lay before it. The country's infrastructural base made any sort of "advanced" healthcare provisions virtually impossible outside of its largest cities and, as such, a conscious decision has been made to prioritize preventative treatment aimed at prophylactics of scores of common infectious and epidemic diseases, as well as universal vaccination and immunization. 


This is a common trend among communist nations around the globe (or at least those that actually tried to create a functioning healthcare system). You could still see a (rather extreme) version of this system in, for example, North Korea, where it has been preserved in time like a fossil in amber. Due to the government's ability to control large chunks of people's lives under the Soviet and other Communist systems with relatively little concerns for privacy, the provision of preventative healthcare was much easier than in the democratic countries of the West for example. 


In addition, much of the health care system was centered around the needs of city dwellers and industrial workers, making it in many ways subordinate to industrial requirements brought upon by both the collectivization and the accelerated industrialization taking place in the late 1920s-through 1930s. This both lowered the average pay, and gave the start to a somewhat disproportionate recruitment of women into medical professions (more on that later). This was made doubly-so important because one of the only legitimate reasons for foregoing work at the time was sickness, as certified by a licensed medical practitioner. 


Cheap and simple health checks (which were *compulsory* for everyone and were supposed to be taken annually) were meant to locate and diagnose, and hopefully treat, medical problems at their earliest stages. The same with immunization (also compulsory). This focus on simple and inexpensive prophylactics (which included basic hygiene) at the early stages of Soviet healthcare system's development allowed them to markedly improve the overall health situation in the country relatively cheaply - as young people seldom die of chronic conditions requiring expensive treatments, with complicated conditions tending to develop later on in life, the majority of threats at a young age come from minor ailments, which can be identified and combated with relative ease provided there is a semi-competent doctor nearby. 


However, this also meant that while the early Soviet healthcare system (early in this case largely means pre-WWII, and sometimes even pre-1930) was well prepared to deal with fractured bones and cholera, it was poorly equipped to deal with complicated conditions and mental illnesses. This approach, however, still allowed Russian (as it varied between national republics) life-expectancy to peak at or around 70 years in the mid 1960s, not far from the Western European averages at the time. This translates to around 64 years for men and 73 years for women (with the corresponding figures for France and the US in 1965 being approximately 67.5 and 66.8 for men, and 74.7 and 73.7 for women respectively). Similarly, the number of physicians was very high, especially for what was in effect a developing country - the number of physicians per 10.000 people hovered between 33 and 35, topping at around 37 physicians per 10.000 people in the late 1970s-early 1980s. In comparison in the United States at the time it was around 19-20 physicians per 10.000 people). Present day Russia and many of the post-Soviet states still retain high numbers of physicians per capita left from the Soviet system. Today, there are approximately 33.06 physicians per 10.000 people in Russia, higher than both United States and Canada (25.54 and 24.07 respectively), and around the same as France (32.27).


However, this approach is characterized by diminishing returns on investment. When discounting the effects of the Second World War, the successes stemming from the focus on eradicating and combating infectious diseases and providing primary health care and vaccines topped out by the 1960s. From that point onward —Åardiovascular diseases became one of the primary causes of non-violent death in the Soviet Union. This is the trend that was noted across the industrialized world, with low rates of infectious diseases, and growing rates of cardiovascular diseases and 
cancer.


The Soviet system did not adapt well to the changing patterns of an older, more urban population. Increases in substance abuse also started to take a toll. The amount of resources devoted to healthcare did not increase accordingly (it is estimated that it stayed relatively constant at around 2-3% between 1960 and 1970). In comparison, in United States it increased from 5% in 1960, to around 8% in 1983. As a result of that, as well as the start of the decline of the Soviet economy as a whole, in the early 1970s Soviet Union became the only major industrialized nation that experienced a decline in life expectancy at that time (it fell to around 63-64 years in 1982), with an increase in the gap between males and females (an average male was expected to live around 10-12 years less than an average female at the time). 


Similarly,  starting around that time (early to mid 1970s) the quality of the provided care started to decline. Despite high numbers of doctors, the infrastructure base was not modernized and drugs were difficult to come by. It was commonplace to see patients' families bringing food to their relatives in hospitals in order to supplement the relatively meager hospital diets. Overcrowding and hospital induced infections became a constant problem. Common and easily preventable mistakes such as infusions of mismatched blood types and AIDS infections due to improperly sanitized equipment became more common and led to more deaths. Infant mortality rates started to climb alongside general mortality. The downside of having a large number of underpaid medical personnel was that the level of training lagged behind the West, as did the quality of service provided by the vast majority of practitioners (which is obviously less noticeable when dealing with relatively simple ailments which require both less specialized training and equipment). The initial emphasis on practical fundamental skills over scientific knowledge started to become a problem with the lack of major reforms in the sector.  


The early focus on preventative treatments led to massive inadequacies in terms of available equipment as the funding was not allocated to the production of equipment that Western public would have associated with modern medicine. The number of available pacemakers in the late 1970s was somewhere under 1000, kidney machines under 150 units, CT scanners around 50 units by some estimates (in the entire country, that is). Even disposables like syringes, bedding, and tubing equipment were meant to be reused. The supply of non-medical equipment, such as cars, building materials, textiles, and so on was erratic and becoming more so. In cases when hospitals and polyclinics did have operating cars (and they were supposed to due to the importance of ambulatory and domiciliary care in the Soviet system), most had troubles with acquiring enough petrol to keep them running. More than half of all the X-Ray film was of such low quality as to make it virtually useless. Doctors and nurses spent around 11 days each year just copying and summarizing patient charts *by hand*.



As a result of chronic under-funding and resource shortages by the late 70s-early 80s the Soviet system started to fail at what it used to be good at, like preventative care. Influenza rates increased, as did the numbers of deaths attributed to it. Typhoid fever made a come back, as did rickets. Cancer screening and diagnostics lagged behind the West, with more than 50% of cases not recognized until they reach their terminal stages.  The toll taken by alcoholism was becoming a real problem, with some estimates stating that tens of thousands of people per year died in alcohol-related fatal accidents alone. By the late 1980s the HIV rates were nearing epidemic levels. 



The egalitarian nature of the early Soviet healthcare system started to unravel as well. In order to acquire better and more personalized care many people resorted to bribes. By the 1980s if one expected to get anything done properly and on time, they would have to pay bribes at almost every step, even though ostensibly the system remained free, while the unofficial combined "costs" for some of the procedures and services exceeded average monthly salaries. 



At the time there in effect existed two separate healthcare systems. Most people were treated in polyclinics and hospitals run and funded by the Ministry of Health, accounting for around 94% of all health care provisions in the country at the time. A parallel "closed" system for the elites was both disproportionately better funded (in relation to the amount of people it treated) and provided better quality care. 



Attempted reforms failed to stem the tide of increasing mortality and decreasing life expectancy. The collapse of the Soviet system caused a further **massive** drop in life expectancy, though that is probably best left for another discussion. On a personal note, I always considered Russian and other post-Soviet health professionals to be some of the most important and yet unsung heroes of the destitute post-Soviet transition period. A lot of doctors struggled to get by on what little they were being paid at the time, often having to take additional jobs on the side or resorting to, for example, growing their own food at a time when the demand for their services was at its highest. 




**For some general information regarding the Soviet health care system. **




Polyclinics were (and are) responsible for around 70 to 80% of all patient care and treatment. Usual catchment areas for urban clinics hovered around 30.000 to 50.000 people, who were seen to by around 20 to 30 general practitioners, who were supported by various teams of specialists, such as surgeons, radiologists, cardiologists, endocrinologists, rheumatologists, neurologists, and so on. Again, noting the preventative emphasis of the Soviet healthcare system, they were often supplemented by specialists responsible for ailments and injuries caused by common (and uncommon) hazards, such as pollution experts and toxicologists. Most of the polyclinics had an alcoholic centre, and most of the larger ones also had a gynecologic department, but dermatological, psychiatric, physiological, dental, and pediatric care were provided separately. Pediatric polyclinics used a tiered system, seeing healthy children on set days centered on routine checks and immunizations, while sick children were actually treated on other days so as to minimize risks of spreading illnesses and causing distress. There also existed networks of specialized clinics (for example dealing with burns or circulatory illnesses), but those were relatively few and far between. 




To answer your last question, yes, they did do house calls, and a lot of them. Partially it was due to the low availability of hospital beds, so in some cases ailments that would have ordinarily called for a hospitalization were treated at home, with predictable effects for quality.  You could get one by dialing "03" from any landline phone, and specify your situation (whether it's an emergency, and what sort of a treatment you required). This service was considered to be one of the most important in the Soviet health care system. Until 1960 there was very little in the way of on-house treatment though. In 1960 the Soviet Ministry of Health issued a decree on further improvements in ambulatory health, which stipulated that all children suspected of having developed respiratory illnesses or have been in contact with people who have developed respiratory illnesses should only be treated at home, and it sort of snowballed from there. By the 1980s the Soviets were treated at home at around 5 times the rates of West Europeans. Even though the wait times would balloon as well (getting a house-call done would normally take around 3 times as long as a consultation at your local polyclinic), sometimes upwards of two hours for it to arrive (and a lot more if you lived in a rural area), this remained a highly in-demand staple of the Soviet health care system. [This is an example of a typical Soviet ambulance](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/UAZ_452%2C_Ambulances%2C_Koryazhma.JPG?uselang=ru) that is still widely in use today. It was nicknamed "loaf" (as in bread) due to its shape. That being said, a large proportion of non-emergency house calls were for children and not adults, although large numbers of adults still made use of that service for one reason or another. 

The notions about the importance of pain relief, so popular in the West, were often dismissed out of hand in the Soviet Union, where many of the painful but common medical procedures did not imply the use of any anesthetic, particularly in the dental care. I can personally attest to that, as well as note that comforting words and caring gestures in general were rather uncommon, even at the level of pediatrics and ESPECIALLY childbirth, as I witnessed when my family members were going through maternity wards. To an outside observer this sort of treatment could appear downright cruel. For example, and I know that I am not supposed to introduce personal anecdotes here, so don't take this as anything other than my anecdotal experience, when attending childbirth, and in response to complaints about the pain, the attending nurses would sometimes say things like "if you didn't want to go through pain, you shouldn't have opened up your legs", which is pretty shocking to a Western observer. This is not to say that the doctors and nurses didn't care as such (or, god forbid, *were* cruel), but rather to demonstrate the prevailing attitudes and low morale levels. If you are interested specifically in the topic of childbirth, I highly recommend this recent article on the evolution (or lack thereof) of the practice in modern Russia. Sadly, [it's in Russian](https://meduza.io/feature/2017/07/17/kak-rozhayut-v-rossii-reportazh-meduzy), but Google translate does a good enough job of getting most of the points across.  




Also of note is the general low pay and the lack of prestige often associated with the profession in the West. An ordinary's physician's salary in the late 1980s was around 120-150 roubles, around 40-50 roubles below the national average (around 185 roubles), around half of those of the engineers. For nursing staff the basic pay was around 90-130 roubles with additional overtime (and a great deal, if not all nurses in the Soviet Union and nowadays still, are doing tremendous amounts of overtime, not always paid). With that being said, medical workers qualified for state-provided housing (small apartments) with low rental rates (less than 5% of their monthly pay for nurses). The storyline of one of the most popular Soviet (romantic) comedies, "The Irony of Fate", hinges in no small part on the fact that one of the heroes, who is a popular and affable surgeon in a regular polyclinic, was only allocated a tiny apartment that he is forced to share with his mother. While doctors tended to command a certain modicum of respect from the society at large, at least until the quality of healthcare started to noticeable decline, they certainly did not constitute a privileged (or, indeed, even a well-off) group in the Soviet society (which applies to almost any other country in the Eastern Bloc).  Interestingly enough, nurses were usually trained by doctors and physicians, with ACTUAL nurses mostly only being involved at the residency level.




As for the gender aspect, almost all nursing staff and up to 80% of doctors (general practitioners, although the term itself didn't exist in the Soviet Union, mostly replaced by "physician" or "therapist") were female in the Soviet Union. The majority of consultants, senior polyclinic and hospital staff, as well as surgeons, were male, however. Partially it is a result of an initial focus on the needs of industrial workers, and, later on, an effect of several destructive conflicts that lowered the male population.




As I've [outlined](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/67i6rp/how_did_one_go_about_getting_a_job_in_the_ussr/dgr30da/) in my other answer on general employment trends in the Soviet Union, while the education was free (and a general practitioner would ordinarily get around 6 years of training plus 1 year of residency, with the nurse getting around 2 or 3 years of training, dependent on the length of basic schooling they received prior to specialized training), in exchange you would be expected to accept a position offered by the government on graduation (usually for around 2 or 3 years).  




Fun fact: starting from 1971 Soviet doctors (physicians in particular) did not take the Hippocratic Oath (or the Osteopathic one for that matter), instead having adopted an alternative ["oath of physician of the Soviet Union."](http://www.nytimes.com/1971/04/21/archives/a-version-of-hippocratic-oath-adopted-for-soviet-physicians.html?mcubz=0&_r=0) Notable differences include the somewhat predictable reference to Communist morals and the addition in 1983 of a paragraph pledging their support for world peace and the prevention of nuclear war in recognition of the dangers of the nuclear weapons. One of the contested points within that oath was the part where a physician pledges to dedicate **all** of his or hers (and most, around 70%, of the Soviet physicians were female) knowledge and energies to safeguarding and improving human health. After the fall of the Union, the new Russian oath removed the "*all*" part and also added a sentence prohibiting euthanasia.


**This is by no means a comprehensive overview, and there is quite a lot more to be said, but I will try to answer any further questions to the best of my abilities. Importantly, I must note that much of what I said applies to the European parts of the Soviet Union, and could vary in many ways in other parts, such as Central Asia (although not so much in cities).**

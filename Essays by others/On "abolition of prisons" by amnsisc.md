This question is the "if we got rid of capitalism why would people work" of prison abolition.

It's like, pick up one of the maybe, 100, criminology & theory books on prison abolition, mass incarceration, restorative justice and so on, and just read about it.

---

It's usually framed as this all at once process.  But considering that legalizing all plaintiff-less crimes (drugs, sex work, gambling, etc) would seriously dent the prison system, primarily, with around 50% of Federal Prisoners, but maybe more like 25-33% of State.  Given that these predict around >25-75% of murders though, the secondary results would be substantial as well.

On top of this, we get rid of mandatory minimums, 3 strikes, truth in sentencing, etc and we reform parole to not be a horrible morass. There goes quite a few more.

Where possible, current penalties are replaced with restitution & fines, but more importantly, restorative justice & rehabilitation.  Considering that incarceration *increases* re-offense rates by 3-7% and restorative justice reduces it, on average, by 7%, and rehabilitation programs have up to a 40% success rate, the combined effect would be a 50% reduction in re-offense.

Also, obviously, abolishing police, starting community programs, jobs programs, mental health programs & so on will have vastly reduced the initial crime rate & re-offense rate.

Okay, so now we're talking, what, 10-15 years from now, and the prison population will have fallen perhaps to its current lifers without parole, and new offenses, will be much lower, in general.

---

So, then, the questions becomes, given a substantially lower rate of crime & a much more just way of dealing with it, how do we deal with the *already incarcerated people* by reintegrating them into the world and, when 'despicable' things still happen what do we do?

Now, for the first question, its an empirical, not a moral question, and though victims and their families will often protest, as is their right, the question is how to facilitate their re-entry in ways far away from & compensatory to the victims.

But, for the second, the one he's proposing, is based off a hypothetical, which is--given a substantially lower offense rate, the absent of criminogenic drug & moral prohibitions, given access to education, mental health & employment, given access to restoration & rehabilitation, 'what do we do' (I hate that phrasing) with those who still commit 'despicable' crimes--it would seem the answer would be: the same thing 'we do' with everyone else.

We determine the degree to which a path of restoration & restitution can be taken, and take it.  We determine the extent to which different factors, such as environment, untreated mental health issues & poor enculturation, and the extent to which those can be rectified, solved & so on. 

Will their be morally offensive people, whose treatment & restoration offends us fundamentally? Almost certainly--*but is that a reason to support incarceration and the caging, brutalizing & killing of people, in general?*

And, if we make the exception that prison is *right* for some particular class of offense, doesn't this undercut the *moral* objection to retribution & incarceration and the *empirical* objection that incarceration doesn't work, increases offense rates & almost, always, everywhere is discretionary, corrupt, abused, brutal & discriminatory, even in the most 'ideal' conditions?

---

Now, what do we do with the people, for whom, after repeated actions, it  doesn't 'take', so to speak, then, we have, what for me, is the nuclear option, which is segregation from society, at large, but in a non-carceral manner, with access to the vagaries of life, and in which one's residence is entirely conditional on being 'unreformed'--even this is a slippery slope for my sensibilities, but, if, in theory, there were some alternative, relatively open, community, dedicated to reformation, but lacking iron bars, prison guards and, so on, but instead has employment, education, leisure, therapy etc, and to the extent possible, family, I wouldn't be, in principle, opposed to it, though would be very skeptical. 

---

The method here, where one imagines the most brutal possible, serial, repeat crime, and then, says, "look! I found something that offends my moral intuition and therefore is deserving of retribution", but this is just a form of assuming what one is trying to prove: namely, that, 'retribution', let alone 'carceral retribution', is *just, equitable, efficient & moral*--which itself is a very easily disprovable proposition, if one follows the current criminology, social psychology, philosophy, critical theory, neuroscience, genetics, anthropology, political science & economics of the question--it is basically beyond a shadow of a doubt that free will is entirely nonsense, whether one argues from a metaphysical viewpoint (hard causality), a logical one (fatalism) or an empirical one .

The fact that situations determine 80% of our behavior alone, not accounting for genetics, epigenetic, upbringing, neural fluke, culture & so on, which, in sum, determine maybe 99% of our behavior in the most well trained Buddhist Monk, but the majority for the rest of us--hedging a theory of punishment on the 1% of our behavior explained by rational evaluative thought, in direct contradiction, to any coherent theory of causality & logical relation, to me, seems, a fool's endeavor.

The fact that no equitable or efficient system of punishment, let alone carceral punishment, has ever existed, should do so as well.

> I want to live a decent life. 


We have the means and technology to house, clothe, feed, mend, and educate every single person, what might we accomplish if we just accepted that without worrying about "deservedness" or petty compensation? 


Nobody asked to exist, why have we arranged things such that people have to justify their existence to a property owner to get magic paper to in-turn give to other property owners for the needs of life? 


> Additionally, being an engineer is difficult. It’s not an easy profession, so why would I still want to be an engineer if I don’t have really have some kind of benefit to it over other professions?


Is this benefit you speak of housing and food security? Do you require other people to be without homes and bread to feel satisfied in having those yourself? Does your bread taste better knowing others are going without? 


> If I don’t get a real tangible benefit to my work in the form of money and private property, why should I want that?


Is magic paper and control of property the only things that motivate people? Assuming the needs of life are guaranteed to all, would people just become inert globs of flesh staring vacantly at walls?


You might be surprised in the [things that actually motivate people](https://youtu.be/aUWGHTiKr8Y).


> Anyway, I’m trying to understand why people do like communism so much.


I am communist because I watched my dad work himself into an early grave making sure my family could eat and have a home. He sacrificed his being, the limited time he had on this rock, just to get magic paper so we could have bread. He didn't get to develop what was peculiar and interesting about himself, he worked a job he hated, that kept him from his family for long stretches, so we could have bread. Under the circumstances that is noble, and worthy of commemoration, but it should never have been necessary. No decent or just society would force a man from his family so some property owner leagues away can post quarterly profit growth. We are so much more than numbers on a spreadsheet. 


> But I do genuinely feel that a lack of private property would cause stagnation.


I think it will lead to an explosion of creativity in all directions, as the mass of people would no longer be reduced to daily toil for meager subsistence, or forced into a rut acquiring property beyond what they could ever use. Instead *all people* would be able to improve and develop, freely, what is peculiar and interesting about themselves. 


There is so much talent and genius wasted to the throes of poverty, left in the heep and never realized. What might we accomplish if we actually advanced past simple capital reproduction just for the sake of reproducing capital?

Sure. Socialists have a tendency to be divisive toward each other over nit-picky things, but most of the time it boils own to views on 4 things:

1) The State

2) Markets

3) Political parties

4) Revolution in general

Since most people agree with certain points on either side of these debates, I'm not going to list off 500 ideologies and sub-sets of them, but instead,  I'll lay out issues, and some important groups on either side.

* 1) The State:

**Anarchists, Libertarian Marxists, Left Communists, and Autonomous Marxists are anti-state:**

They see it as oppressive, and that's the big thing. It's oppressive, most often no matter who's in charge. Other reasons cited by other groups include the Left Communists' criticism that the state will not be needed anyway because revolutionaries will form their own local councils, Autonomous Marxists' criticisms that the state is not where revolutionary energy should be focused, and others.

**Marxist-Leninists, Maoists, and Trotskyists support a *revolutionary* state:**

That means that they don't want any crazy dictatorship, but support a state run by the working-class, so that the gov't can be run in the interests of the majority. There are other claims in support, like Trotsky and Lenin's claim that the state is essential to defeating the bourgeoisie militarily, and Mao's claim that the state is an organizing arm for revolutionaries.

* 2) Markets:

**Market Socialists, Social-Democrats, Mutualists, and Georgists support markets and exchange/sale/trading of goods:**

Some claim that it is inevitable, and others claim that it is natural for people to do it. Social-Democrats claim that abolishing markets really just isn't needed to make people's lives better. Georgists claim that some degree of exchange is inevitable in a world full of stuff that can be exchanged. Support of financial markets varies, with mutualists disliking profit and speculation, and with social-democrats supporting these things.

**Communists and Syndicalists are against most competitive sales markets:**

This does not mean that they support the gov't giving people everything. Communists specifically support community production of things whose distribution is voted on by the community. Syndicalists put trust in worker/employee-managed trade unions and workplace-federations to distribute products and organize production, rather than allowing things to be sold so that people can make money off of consumers, which in their view, is exploitative.

* 3) Political parties:

**Anarchists, Left Communists, and Autonomous Marxists are against political party activity:**

This is because they see working-class organizations as more important and relevant to revolutionary struggle and change. There are other reasons also, like the anarchists' dislike of the state, and the Autonomous Marxist criticism that political parties seek to do things better done by the working class on its own, like making socialist ideas popular, or leading the working class.

**Marxist-Leninists, Maoists, Trotskyists, Social-Democrats, and non-Anarchist Syndicalists support forming political parties:**

They believe that parties are better at achieving working-class goals. Trotskyists and Leninists claim that it makes revolution easier, while non-revolutionary Social-Democrats believe that it is how one goes about representing left-wing ideas in parliaments, instead of using activist means or movements, though Social-Democrats disagree as to how important activism is.

* 4) Revolution (more than two groups here):

**Social-Democrats do not support working-class revolutions:**

This isn't necessarily because they are anti-working-class, but instead because of their belief that they either aren't needed, are too violent, or are not possible in today's political climate.

**Marxist-Leninists, Trotskyists, and Maoists support party-led revolutions by the working-class:**

This means that they agree with the idea of bringing revolutions to change society's structure, but want it to be organized via a political party. Reasons why include the belief that parties keep things organized, keep the revolution on track, and keep workers revolutionarily inclined, and not susceptible to being tricked by non-revolutionary groups.

**Left-Communists, Autonomous Marxists, Anarchists, and most Syndicalists agree with a non-party-oriented social revolution:**

What distinguishes these from the former is their dislike of political parties, instead wanting the working class to lead the revolution on its own in order to bring change. Reasons why include the belief from Left Communists that party organizations are not revolutionary organizations, and that the working-class will organize by taking over their workplaces and managing them with revolutionary councils. Autonomous Marxists agree, but also claim,along with anarchists, that the aim of the revolution would also be to either neutralize (anarchists) or radically recreate state structures (Autonomous Marxists) so as to achieve proletarian goals, instead of seizing the state that currently exists.

Well, there you have it; the big differences that socialists have with each other. There are *plenty* others, but these are the big ones.

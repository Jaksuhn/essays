There are a few things it's important to say in reply:

1. Economic Democracy is not the same sort of economy that was employed by the Soviet Union. Theirs was a planned economy. Economic Democracy is a form of market socialism. Market socialism was really only tried once, in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and it was actually [very successful](http://www.globaltenders.com/economy-yugoslavia.htm). 

2. It is not at all clear based on the real evidence that the Soviet Union's economy did poorly because of their style of economy. An economist named Peter Murrell published an article called "Can Neoclassical Economics Underpin the Reform of Centrally Planned Economies?" It reviewed 18 studies of the efficiency of the Soviet planned economy and found it was comparably productive to Western market economies although consistently less productive overall. Two other economists, Moroney and Lovell, published a study called "The Relative Efficiencies of Market and Planned Economies" that looked at 7 centrally planned economies and 17 market economies and found that, overall, the planned economies were about three-fourths as efficient as the market economies.

3. It is also very important to note that [the Soviet Union was under constant attack from the United States and other countries, even from the very beginning.](http://www.amazon.com/Americas-Secret-War-against-Bolshevism/dp/0807849588) As a result of being under constant siege, the Soviet Union became more and more controlled by a small bureaucratic ruling class that subjugated the working people of that country instead of empowering them and spent massive amounts of money on the arms race with the United States. 

4. The fact that Russia was socially and economically devastated by World War I and their civil war also strongly suggests that it wasn't the economic system itself that failed but rather the conditions in which they first attempted to establish it. I can't find the source right now, but their working class had been reduced to about 40% of what it had been and their industrial capacity was about 12% of what it had been. Socialism requires *abundance*--an industrial economy that is truly capable of making everything that everyone needs. The Soviet Union did not have economic abundance when they first began trying to construct a new society.

Also, a note on terminology:

"Communism" is definitely not something that has ever been actually put into place, nor do any communists say that it has been. All communists agree that communism is a *possible* society in which there is no state (no police, no army), no money (everyone works voluntarily and takes what they need from the common store), and no class (no one is above anyone else on an involuntary societal hierarchy because of wealth, race, sex, or any other reason).

What Economic Democracy *is* is a form of socialism. Socialism is understood as the next step after capitalism toward a more just society, a system that builds on the massive machinery that capitalism has constructed but uses it democratically to further the ends of all people, not just the few who "own" it all. Communism is the hoped-for next step after socialism.

\* \* \*

As I discussed above, "common sense" is completely wrong about how well the economies that got called "socialist" actually worked in practice and why things worked out the way they did in those countries.

We in the West are fed propaganda our whole lives about why capitalism is the best and why socialism will lead to horrors. This is because the super-rich rule the world, and capitalism makes them and keeps them super-rich. It's no wonder that they have tried to make sure that everyone swallows this simple and false truism that any alternative to capitalism "sounds good on paper but doesn't work in practice." It's a lie--look into the matter for yourself.

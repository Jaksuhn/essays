I have [literally just written a book about the Western media coverage of Venezuela](https://www.routledge.com/Bad-News-from-Venezuela-Twenty-years-of-fake-news-and-misreporting/Macleod/p/book/9781138489233), so I suppose this question is in my boathouse and I will give my two cents.

I thought it was grossly deceitful and full of wild distortions. In other words, it was pretty boilerplate media coverage.

For instance, the segment characterized the country as one where a dictatorial Maduro has destroyed the country to the point where “desperate people” throw poo in jars as “one of their last options”. 

But the “protests” he referred to (the 2017 guarimbas) were not led by desperate people, but by a hardcore of [US funded, US trained and US supported](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/09/latin-america-wikileaks-hugo-chavez-rafael-correa-obama-venezuela-intervention/) leaders bent on overthrowing the government through violence. The “protestors” bombed schools, gassed maternity hospitals, tried to kill doctors, destroyed social housing, attacked police and army buildings, [shot journalists](http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Journalists-Being-Targeted-at-Venezuelan-Opposition-Protests-20170605-0024.html), and went out looking for black Venezuelans to lynch. For instance, Orlando Figueroa was caught, stabbed six times, doused in petrol and [burned to death](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/3613757/terrifying-moment-protesters-in-venezuela-set-a-man-on-fire-after-accusing-him-of-stealing-during-rally-against-president/). He would not be the last to suffer the same fate. The stolen helicopter alluded to at the start was used to bomb the central government buildings. The man who did this was described as a “[patriot](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/28/venezuela-helicopter-attack-oscar-perez-rumors)” by The Guardian and his actions a “[protest flight](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/helicopter-flies-against-maduro-heightening-tensions-in-venezuela/2017/06/27/4c85179e-37fa-43db-8c9f-b8380034000a_story.html?utm_term=.0230d65eb6d9)” by The Washington Post. [83%](http://hinterlaces.com/84-esta-de-acuerdo-con-un-dialogo-entre-gobierno-y-oposicion/) of Venezuelans believe the opposition leaders should step down. [81%](http://hinterlaces.com/84-esta-de-acuerdo-con-un-dialogo-entre-gobierno-y-oposicion/) of Venezuelans disagreed with the violent tactics. The leader of the movement, Leopoldo Lopez, was jailed for inciting violence. This is what Oliver is referring to when he talked of Maduro “jailing opponents”. 

A second problem is he lays the blame for the crisis with the government only. He does accurately point to some of the causes of the economic problems – “unrealistic price controls” – but ignores completely the business community and the US, despite the fact that US media [openly note](https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-12-01/venezuelas-currency-value-depends-largely-one-guy-alabama-home-depot)is controlled by exiled opposition the exchange rate is controlled by exiled opposition members in the USA. 

In fact, he goes further and says, “What’s happening in Venezuela is actually not our fault. Accusing America of creating Venezuela’s crisis is about as fair as accusing OJ Simpson of murdering Princess Diana.” This is simply a lie of the highest order. The US has spent over $100 million training, supporting and funding opposition leaders and parties, has been involved in coup d’etat attempts and is actively hitting the economy with sanctions and threatening any bondholder not to renegotiate Venezuelan debt. Marco Rubio [announced](https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/961969524630347776) “The world would support the Armed Forces in Venezuela if they decide to protect the people & restore democracy by removing a dictator” while Trump [said](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/aug/11/donald-trump-venezuela-crisis-military-intervention) “We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option, if necessary.”


And yet, Oliver casts Trump’s sanctions as a way to help the country. This is despite the [UN General Assembly](http://undocs.org/A/HRC/37/L.34) coming out last week condemning the US sanctions as highly illegal, noting how acutely they are affecting ordinary Venezuelans, calling on all member states not to apply them and take action against the US, even discussing reparations the US should pay to Venezuela. Don’t waste your time trying to find that reported in the US press. 

Thus, the impression built up is one of a “dictatorship” that is still likely to win the coming elections because of fraud. And yet, this position is not a majority one inside Venezuela. In fact, Less than one in five opposition party members described the country as totally undemocratic when asked to rate the democracy from 1-10 by Latinobarometro, a prestigious and bitterly anti-chavista polling agency, the average opposition answer being [4.4/10](https://i.imgur.com/cDtTZz9.png). In fact, ordinary Venezuelans were much more likely to rate their country’s democracy a perfect 10/10 than a 1/10 on the 2015 survey, the last available to check. That position is so foreign to the US media that I am willing to bet even people on this sub won’t believe it. Therefore you should go and check [for yourself here](http://www.latinobarometro.org/latOnline.jsp). Oliver also whitewashes over the opposition, who even the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/11/15/the-odds-of-a-military-coup-in-venezuela-are-going-up-that-may-not-be-a-bad-thing/?utm_term=.651a668e2a0a) calls “hopelessly ineffective”. Therefore, the story goes, Maduro will win because it is a dictatorship, not due to the fact that the extremely violent opposition, funded by the US, is actively trying to tank the economy.

# The History of Climate Denial

### The Following is Chapter Eight from Jane Mayer's *Dark Money*

In the final months before the 2008 presidential election, Michael Mann, a tenured
meteorology and geosciences professor at Penn State University who had become a
leading figure in climate change research, told his wife that he would be happy whichever
candidate won. Both the Republican and the Democratic presidential nominees had
spoken about the importance of addressing global warming, which Mann regarded as the
paramount issue of the day. But what he didn’t fully foresee was that the same forces
stirring the Tea Party would expertly channel the public outrage at government against
scientific experts like himself.

Mann had started out unconvinced by the science of climate change, but in 1999 he and
two co-authors had published a study tracking the previous thousand years of temperatures
in the Northern Hemisphere. It included a simple, easy-to-grasp graph showing that the
earth’s temperature had hovered in a more or less straight line for nine hundred years but
then shot sharply upward, like the blade of a hockey stick, in the twentieth century. What
came to be known as the hockey stick graph was so powerfully persuasive it gained iconic
status within the climate debate. By 2008, Mann, like most experts, had long since
concluded that the scientific evidence was overwhelming that human beings were
endangering the earth’s climate by burning too much oil, gas, and coal. The carbon
dioxide and other gases these fuels released were trapping the earth’s heat, with
devastating effects.

As even the Pentagon, a cautious bastion of technological nonpartisanship, concluded,
“the danger from climate change is real, urgent, and severe.” An official U.S. National
Security Strategy report declared the situation a growing national security threat, arguing,
“The change wrought by a warming planet will lead to new conflicts over refugees and
resources; new suffering from drought and famine; catastrophic natural disasters; and the
degradation of land across the globe.” The report unambiguously predicted that if nothing
were done, “climate change and pandemic disease” would directly threaten “the health and
safety of the American people.”

The American Association for the Advancement of Science, the world’s largest and
most prestigious scientific society, was equally if not more adamant. It warned that “we
face risks of abrupt, unpredictable and potentially irreversible changes” with potentially
“massively disruptive consequences.”

Mann wasn’t particularly political. Middle-aged, friendly, and balding, with a dark
goatee shadowing his round face, he was a quintessential science nerd who had majored in
applied math and physics at the University of California, Berkeley, got advanced degrees
in geology and geophysics at Yale, and for many years didn’t think scientists had much of
a role to play in public policy. When Obama won, he recalls, “I shared the widespread
view that we would see some action on the climate front.”

Certainly this assumption seemed reasonable. On the night that Obama clinched the
Democratic nomination, he spoke passionately about climate change, vowing that
Americans would look back knowing that “this was the moment when the rise of the
oceans began to slow and our planet began to heal.” Once in office, he pledged to pass a
“cap and trade” bill forcing the fossil fuel industry to pay for its pollution, as other
industries did, rather than treating it as someone else’s problem. Cap and trade was a
market-based solution, originally backed by Republicans, requiring permits for carbon
emissions. The theory was that it would give the industry a financial incentive to stop
polluting. It had worked surprisingly well in previous years to reduce industrial emissions
that caused acid rain. By choosing a tested, moderate, bipartisan approach, the Obama
administration and many environmentalists assumed a deal would be winnable.

“What we didn’t take into account,” Mann later noted, “was the ferociousness of the
moneyed interests and the politicians doing their bidding. We are talking about a direct
challenge to the most powerful industry that has ever existed on the face of the earth.
There’s no depth to which they’re unwilling to sink to challenge anything threatening their
interests even if it’s science and the scientists involved in it.”

Mann contended that “the fossil fuel industry is an oligarchy.” Some might dispute that
American oil, gas, and coal magnates met the dictionary definition of a small, privileged
group that effectively rules over the majority. But it was indisputable that they funded and
helped orchestrate a series of vitriolic personal attacks that would threaten Mann’s
livelihood, derail climate legislation, and alter the course of the Obama presidency.

If there was a single ultra-wealthy interest group that hoped to see Obama fail as he
took office, it was the fossil fuel industry. And if there was one test of its members’
concentrated financial power over the machinery of American democracy, it was this
minority’s ability to stave off government action on climate change as science and the rest
of the world were moving in the opposite direction. While Obama’s health-care bill was
useful in riling up Tea Party protesters, his environmental and energy policies were the
real target of many of the multimillionaires and billionaires in the Koch circle. For most of
the world’s population the costs of inaction on climate change were far greater than those
of action. But for the fossil fuel industry, as Mann put it, “it’s like the switch from whale
oil in the nineteenth century. They’re fighting to maintain the status quo, no matter how
dumb.”

—

Coal, oil, and gas magnates formed the nucleus of the Koch donor network. Guest lists
for the summits read like a Who’s Who of America’s most successful and most
conservative fossil fuel barons, the majority of whom were private, independent operators
of privately owned companies. They were men who had either made or inherited
enormous fortunes in “extractive” energy without having to answer to public shareholders
or much of anyone else. Among the group, for instance, was Corbin “Corby” Robertson
Jr., the grandson of one of Texas’s most legendary oil barons, Hugh Roy Cullen.

Robertson, a former captain of the football team at the University of Texas, from which he
graduated in 1969, had taken a bold, unorthodox risk with his inherited oil fortune. He had
bet almost all of it on coal, reportedly accumulating by 2003 the single largest private
cache of coal reserves in America. He owned, by one count, twenty-one billion tons of
coal reserves—enough to fuel the entire country for twenty years. Only the U.S.
government reportedly owned more coal than his private, Houston-based company,
Quintana Resources Capital.

Other donors in the network included Harold Hamm and Larry Nichols, two of the most
successful pioneers in “fracking,” the environmentally controversial process by which
water and chemicals are injected underground into rock formations to extract oil and
natural gas. Hamm, the founder of Continental Resources, was a self-made billionaire
wildcatter whom the National Journal likened to John D. Rockefeller. While his nearly
billion-dollar divorce settlement and amazing rise from being born the youngest of
thirteen children in a family of sharecroppers made tabloid history, business journals were
more focused on his company, which almost overnight had become the face of fracking in
North Dakota’s Bakken Shale.

Joining him in the network, on the opposite end of the social scale, was Larry Nichols,
head of Devon Energy and later chairman of the American Petroleum Institute, the
foremost trade association for the oil industry. A graduate of Princeton and a former
Supreme Court clerk, Nichols had urged his family’s Oklahoma energy company to buy
Mitchell Energy after he noticed that its natural gas output was climbing because of
fracking. Nichols combined the process with his own company’s expertise in horizontal
drilling to “unleash what became known as the unconventional gas revolution,” as the
energy industry historian Daniel Yergin wrote in The Quest. The Kochs, too, had
investments in the chemicals, pipelines, and other aspects of fracking.

The donor network also boasted spectacularly successful oilmen like Philip Anschutz,
heir to a western oil-drilling fortune, who himself discovered a fabled oil field on the
Wyoming-Utah border in the 1980s, after which he diversified into ranches, railroads, and
communications. The network included many smaller operators too. There were oilmen
from Wyoming, Oklahoma, Texas, and Colorado and coal magnates from Virginia, West
Virginia, Kentucky, and Ohio. The largest distributor of propane canisters in the country
was also involved. Participating, too, were many of those whose businesses provided
ancillary support to America’s energy sector. In addition to the Kochs there were
numerous other owners of pipelines, drilling equipment, and oil service companies,
including the legendary Bechtel family, which made billions building refineries and
pipelines in Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, and elsewhere.

Most of the actual donors in this group preferred to keep low profiles, letting the
politicians speak for them. They were expert in casting the group’s reservations about
government regulation in lofty philosophical terms. The politicians called them “job
creators” and patriots, responsible for American energy independence. Clearly, though,
there were few Americans for whom government caps on carbon posed a more direct
financial threat.

The problem for this group was that by 2008 the arithmetic of climate change presented
an almost unimaginable challenge. If the world were to stay within the range of carbon
emissions that scientists deemed reasonable in order for atmospheric temperatures to
remain tolerable through the mid-century, 80 percent of the fossil fuel industry’s reserves
would have to stay unused in the ground. In other words, scientists estimated that the
fossil fuel industry owned roughly five times more oil, gas, and coal than the planet could
safely burn. If the government interfered with the “free market” in order to protect the
planet, the potential losses for these companies were catastrophic. If, however, the carbon
from these reserves were burned wantonly without the government applying any brakes,
scientists predicted an intolerable rise in atmospheric temperatures, triggering potentially
irreversible global damage to life on earth.

As early as 1997, one member of the Koch group sounded the alarm about the coming
regulatory threat. That year Lew Ward, the retiring chairman of the Independent Petroleum
Association of America, the trade group of independent oil and gas producers, delivered a
jeremiad as his swan song. Ward, who was himself an Oklahoma oilman, began by
proudly ticking off the various tax loopholes he helped pass during his tenure. “We’ve
been fortunate the past couple of years to have a Republican Congress,” he noted. But he
warned that the various policy “skirmishes” the industry had survived recently were
nothing but “a dress rehearsal for the real show…the possible ‘Carbon Tax’ that could help
pay the costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.” Ward perceived accurately that the
climate change issue was coming and argued that if the “radical environmentalist ‘off-oil’
agenda” succeeded, “we can look down the road a little way and see an industry under
siege.” He vowed, “We are not going to let that happen. You can take that to the bank!”

Ward’s swagger was well-grounded. The oil industry had held parochial but powerful
sway over American politics for years. As early as 1913, the oil industry used its clout to
win a special tax loophole, the “oil depletion allowance.” On the theory that oil
exploration was risky and costly, it enabled the industry to deduct so much income when it
hit gushers that many oil companies evaded income taxes altogether. After the loophole
was scandalously enlarged in 1926, liberals, stymied by the oil patch’s defenders in
Congress, tried unsuccessfully for five decades before they were finally able to close it.

No American politician’s rise to power in the last century was more fueled by oil than
that of Lyndon Johnson. As Robert Caro recounts in The Path to Power, starting in 1940
Johnson rose from a neophyte congressman to the Democratic Party’s consummate power
broker by handing out campaign contributions from his enormously wealthy backers in the
Texas oil fields and defending their interests.

Although the oil industry benefited enormously from the federal government in the
form of favorable tax treatment, huge government contracts, and aid in building pipelines,
as well as other handouts, it became a bastion of antigovernment conservatism. In fact, as
its wealth grew, the Texas oil patch was the source not only of an astounding amount of
campaign lucre but also of a particularly extreme strain of right-wing politics. In his book
about the state’s oil fortunes, The Big Rich, Bryan Burrough speculates that what animated
many of the magnates was “the deep-tissue insecurity of the nouveau riche” who were
hell-bent on keeping all they had just gained.

If there was a progenitor of Texas’s modern-day ultraconservative oil faction, it was
Corby Robertson’s grandfather Hugh Roy Cullen, who helped make Quintana a billiondollar
enterprise. With roots in the fallen gentry of the Confederacy, he belonged to a band
of oilmen that loathed northern liberals, denigrated FDR’s administration as the “Jew
Deal,” and formed a third party whose plank called for “the restoration of the supremacy
of the white race.” Cullen’s political ambitions expanded with his fortune, and in 1952—
half a century before the Kochs became giant political spenders—he was the single
biggest donor in American politics and a key supporter of Senator Joseph McCarthy’s
anti-Communist crusade. But at the time, his brand of radically right-wing, oil-fueled
politics was doomed to be marginalized. Burrough explains that “to succeed in politics
Cullen needed a support organization of some kind, but building one was something he
was unwilling or incapable of doing.” Half a century later, however, with the “Kochtopus”
in place, Cullen’s grandson and fellow oilmen would fare far better.

Opposition to curbs on carbon had long been building in the industry. The concept that
the earth was warming, and mankind was causing it, first broke into the mainstream media
in 1988 when the climate modeler James Hansen, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute
for Space Studies, testified before a Senate committee about it, amid a nationwide heat
wave. The New York Times played his dramatic findings on its front page. During his
presidency, George H. W. Bush, like most political leaders of both parties at the time,
accepted the science without dispute. He vowed to protect the environment, promising to
fight “the Greenhouse Effect with the White House Effect” and sending his secretary of
state, James Baker, to the first international summit of climate scientists, the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Although Bush was a Republican, he was
not an outlier in his party. For decades, the environmental movement had enjoyed
bipartisan support.

As public opinion mounted in favor of climate action, however, the fossil fuel industry
organized and financed a stealthy state-of-the-art counteroffensive. Despite the agreement
of both parties’ presidential candidates in 2008 that something needed to be done to stave
off climate change, powerful outside interests had been working overtime to erode that
consensus. The conservative infrastructure necessary to wage a war of ideas was already
in place. All it took to focus the attack on climate science was money. And beneath the
surface, it was pouring in.

Kert Davies, the director of research at Greenpeace, the liberal environmental group,
spent months trying to trace the funds flowing into a web of nonprofit organizations and
talking heads, all denying the reality of global warming as if working from the same
script. What he discovered was that from 2005 to 2008, a single source, the Kochs, poured
almost $25 million into dozens of different organizations fighting climate reform. The sum
was staggering. His research showed that Charles and David had outspent what was then
the world’s largest public oil company, ExxonMobil, by a factor of three. In a 2010 report,
Greenpeace crowned Koch Industries, a company few had ever heard of at the time, the
“kingpin of climate science denial.”

The first peer-reviewed academic study on the topic added further detail. Robert Brulle,
a Drexel University professor of sociology and environmental science, discovered that
between 2003 and 2010 over half a billion dollars was spent on what he described as a
massive “campaign to manipulate and mislead the public about the threat posed by climate
change.” The study examined the tax records of more than a hundred nonprofit
organizations engaged in challenging the prevailing science on global warming. What it
found was, in essence, a corporate lobbying campaign disguised as a tax-exempt,
philanthropic endeavor. Some 140 conservative foundations funded the campaign, Brulle
found. During the seven-year period he studied, these foundations distributed $558 million
in the form of 5,299 grants to ninety-one different nonprofit organizations. The money
went to think tanks, advocacy groups, trade associations, other foundations, and academic
and legal programs. Cumulatively, this private network waged a permanent campaign to
undermine Americans’ faith in climate science and to defeat any effort to regulate carbon
emissions.

The cast of conservative organizations identified by Brulle was familiar to anyone who
had followed the funding of the modern conservative movement. Among those he
pinpointed as the largest bankrollers of climate change denial were foundations affiliated
with the Koch and Scaife families, both of whose fortunes derived partly from oil. Also
heavily involved were the Bradley Foundation and several others associated with hugely
wealthy families participating in the Koch donor summits, such as foundations run by the
DeVos family, Art Pope, the retail magnate from North Carolina, and John Templeton Jr., a
doctor and heir to the fortune of his father, John Templeton Sr., an American mutual fund
pioneer who eventually renounced his U.S. citizenship in favor of living in the Bahamas,
reportedly saving $100 million on taxes. Brulle found that as the money was dispersed,
three-quarters of the funds from these and other sources financing what he called the
“climate change counter-movement” were untraceable.

“Powerful funders are supporting the campaign to deny scientific findings about global
warming and raise public doubts about the roots and remedies of this massive global
threat. At the very least,” he argued, “American voters deserve to know who is behind
these efforts.”

Instead, by the time Obama took office some of the biggest bankrollers of the war
against climate science had, if anything, gone further underground. Rather than funding
the campaign directly, a growing number of private conservative foundations and donors
had begun directing their contributions through an organization called DonorsTrust that in
essence became a screen for the right wing, behind which fingerprints disappeared from
the cash. Housed in a humdrum brick building in Alexandria, Virginia, DonorsTrust and
its affiliate, Donors Capital Fund, were memorably described by Mother Jones’s Andy
Kroll as “the dark-money ATM of the conservative movement.”

Founded in 1999 by Whitney Ball, an ardent libertarian from West Virginia who had
overseen development of the Koch-founded Cato Institute, DonorsTrust boasted one key
advantage for wealthy conservatives. It made their contributions appear to be going to
Ball’s bland-sounding “donor-advised fund,” rather than to the far more controversial
conservative groups she distributed it to afterward. The mechanism thus erased the donors’
names from the money trail. Meanwhile, the donors retained the same if not bigger
charitable tax deductions. As the DonorsTrust Web site advertised, “You wish to keep your
charitable giving private, especially gifts funding sensitive or controversial issues. Set up a
DonorsTrust account and ask that your gifts remain anonymous. Know that any
contributions to your DonorsTrust account that have to be reported to the IRS will not
become public information. Unlike with private foundations, gifts from your account will
remain as anonymous as you request.”

Between 1999 and 2015, DonorsTrust redistributed some $750 million from the pooled
contributions to myriad conservative causes under its own name. Ordinarily, under the
law, in exchange for their tax breaks, private foundations such as the Charles G. Koch
Foundation were required to publicly disclose the charitable groups to whom they made
their grants. It was one way to assure that these public service organizations were in fact
serving the public. But donor-advised funds defeated this minimum transparency. Ball
argued that the mechanism wasn’t suspicious, or even unusual, and that liberals too had
their own donor-advised fund, the Tides Foundation. DonorsTrust, the conservative
answer to the Tides Foundation, however, soon had four times the funds and a far more
strategic board. Its directors consisted of top officials of several of the most important
institutions in the conservative movement, including the American Enterprise Institute, the
Heritage Foundation, and the Institute for Justice, the libertarian legal center whose startup
funds had been supplied by Charles Koch. They functioned as a central committee,
coordinating grant making.

What Brulle noticed as he studied the money behind climate change denial was that as
criticism of those blocking reform increased around 2007, tens of millions of dollars of
contributions from fossil fuel interests like Koch and ExxonMobil seemed to have
disappeared from the public fight. Meanwhile, a growing and commensurate amount of
anonymous money from DonorsTrust started funding the climate change
countermovement. In 2003, for instance, Brulle found that DonorsTrust money was the
source of only 3 percent of the 140 groups whose financial records he studied. By 2010, it
had grown to 24 percent. The circumstantial evidence suggested that the fossil fuel
interests bankrolling climate change denial were deliberately hiding their hands, but Brulle
couldn’t prove it. “We just have this great big unknown out there about where all the
money is coming from,” he said.

Relations between the Kochs and DonorsTrust were close. Disclosures showed that the
Kochs’ foundations made sizable gifts to DonorsTrust, which in turn dispersed large
amounts of cash to their favorite nonprofit groups. In 2010, for instance, the single largest
grant that it made to any organization was a $7.4 million gift to the Americans for
Prosperity Foundation, whose chairman was David Koch. These funds accounted for
about 40 percent of the AFP Foundation’s funding that year, belying the notion that it was
a genuine grassroots organization. AFP, meanwhile, not only took a lead role in organizing
the Tea Party rebellion but also spearheaded a national drive to block action on climate
change, aiming in every way possible to merge the two movements.

What much of the stealth funding bought was the dissemination of scientific doubt. The
fossil fuel industry thus followed the same deceptive playbook that had been developed by
the public relations firm Hill & Knowlton on behalf of the tobacco companies in the
1960s, in order to fabricate uncertainty about the science linking smoking to cancer. As
the firm’s memo had notoriously put it, “Doubt is our product.” To add credibility to their
side, the tobacco companies funded a network of official-sounding institutes and smokers’
rights groups. This strategy soon characterized the global warming denial movement, too.
There was in fact some uncertainty about global warming, as there is about virtually
every scientific hypothesis. Probability, rather than absolute certainty, is the nature of the
scientific method. But as Dr. James Baker, former head of the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, said in 2005, “There’s a better scientific consensus on this
than on any issue I know—except maybe Newton’s second law of [thermo]dynamics.”

Nonetheless, in 1998, the American Petroleum Institute, along with several top oil
industry executives and conservative think tank officials, colluded on a secret plan to
spend $2 million to confuse the press and the public about this growing scientific
consensus. The plan called for recruiting skeptical scientists and training them in public
relations so that they could act as spokesmen, thereby adding legitimacy and cover to the
industry’s agenda.

According to The Republican War on Science, the plan was the brainchild of William
O’Keefe, a former chief operating officer at the American Petroleum Institute and a
lobbyist for ExxonMobil who became president of the George C. Marshall Institute, a
conservative think tank in Virginia. O’Keefe continued to lobby for ExxonMobil while
heading the research center. Described by Newsweek as a “central cog in the denial
machine,” the think tank specialized in providing contrarian scientific defenses for
dubious clients. Funded by the Scaife, Olin, and Bradley Foundations, among others, it
had begun as a center for Cold War hawks vouching for President Reagan’s “Star Wars”
missile shield, but expanded into debunking other scientific findings that could be
construed as liberal or anticorporate. Money from threatened corporate interests,
meanwhile, frequently funded the research.

Leading the charge against climate science were two elderly, retired physicists affiliated
with the George C. Marshall Institute who had previously defended the tobacco industry,
Fred Seitz and Fred Singer. As Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway write in Merchants of
Doubt, the two Freds had been eminent physicists in their day, but neither had any
expertise in either the environment or health, “yet, for years the press quoted these men as
experts.” What they were in fact expert in was converting a torrent of unseen funding into
“fighting facts, and merchandising doubt,” according to Oreskes and Conway.

But for the fossil fuel industry, winning over public opinion was no easy feat. As the
new millennium dawned, the general public was broadly in favor of environmental
regulations. As late as 2003, over 75 percent of Republicans supported strict
environmental regulations, according to polls. For help on their public relations campaign,
in 2002 the opponents of carbon regulations hired Frank Luntz, who warned that “the
environment is probably the issue on which Republicans in general—and President Bush
in particular—is most vulnerable.” To win, he argued, global warming deniers had to
portray themselves as “preserving and protecting” the environment. In his confidential
memo “Winning the Global Warming Debate,” which eventually leaked to the public,
Luntz stressed as his number one point that opponents of carbon regulations “absolutely”
must “not raise economic arguments first.” In other words, telling the truth about their
financial interests was a recipe for losing.

The key, he went on, was to question the science. “You need to continue to make the
lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate,” he advised. So long as “voters
believe there is no consensus about global warming within the scientific community,” he
said, regulations could be forestalled. Language that “worked,” he advised, included
phrases like “we must not rush to judgment” and “we should not commit America to any
international document that handcuffs us.” Later, Luntz would switch sides and publicly
admit that global warming was a real peril. But in the view of Michael Mann, whose
scientific work soon became the target of climate change deniers, Luntz’s 2002 memo
served as a virtual hunting license. “It basically said you have to discredit the scientists
and create fake groups. It doesn’t say ‘engage in character assassination,’ but it was
leaning in that direction.”

—

On cue, organizations funded and directed by the Kochs tore into global warming
science and the experts behind it. The Cato Institute, the libertarian think tank that Charles
Koch founded, put out a steady stream of reports like Apocalypse Not: Science,
Economics, and Environmentalism and Climate of Fear: Why We Shouldn’t Worry About
Global Warming. A grant from the Charles G. Koch Charitable Foundation, along with
funds from ExxonMobil and the American Petroleum Institute, also helped pay for a nonpeer-reviewed
study claiming that polar bears, who were mascots of the global warming
debate, were not endangered by climate change. It quickly drew criticism from experts in
the field like the National Wildlife Federation, which predicted that by 2050 two-thirds of
the polar bear population would disappear because their habitat was melting. Nonetheless,
the conclusions of the oil-financed study were echoed throughout the network of Kochfunded
groups. “There are more polar bears today than there have ever been,” Ed Crane,
the head of Cato, insisted. He argued that “global warming theories just give the
government more control of the economy.”

It was the authors of the revisionist polar bear study who also took one of the first shots
at Michael Mann’s iconic hockey stick study, publishing a takedown in 2003. The
credentials of the critics, Sallie Baliunas and Wei-Hock “Willie” Soon, looked impressive.
Soon was identified as a scientist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. But
it later emerged that he had a doctoral degree in aerospace engineering, not climate
science, and had only a part-time, unpaid affiliation with the Smithsonian Institution.
Without disclosing it, he had accepted more than $1.2 million from the fossil fuel industry
from 2005 to 2015, including at least $230,000 from the Charles G. Koch Charitable
Foundation. It was later revealed that some of t
he payments for his papers were marked as
“deliverables” by the fossil fuel companies.
Soon’s attack on Mann was so controversial that the editor and several other staffers
sympathetic to Mann resigned in protest against Climate Research, the small journal that
published it. Yet from that moment on, Mann, who was at the time an assistant professor
in the Department of Environmental Sciences at the University of Virginia, had a target on
his back.

—

As the scientific consensus grew in support of global warming, the industry’s efforts to
fight it became increasingly aggressive. The presidential candidacy of the environmental
activist Al Gore in 2000 posed an obvious threat to the fossil fuel industry. That election
cycle, Koch Industries and its employees disbursed over $800,000 in support of his
opponent George W. Bush and other Republicans. Koch Industries’ political action
committee was spending more on federal campaigns than any other oil and gas company,
including ExxonMobil. The company’s expenditures on Washington lobbying expanded
more than twenty-fold from 2004 to 2008, reaching $20 million. The Kochs’ corporate
self-interest had by then thoroughly trumped their youthful disdain for engaging in
conventional politics.

Political contributions from oil, gas, and coal companies became increasingly polarized
during this period. In 1990, the oil and gas industry’s political giving was skewed 60
percent in favor of Republicans and 40 percent in favor of Democrats. By the middle of
the Bush years, 80 percent of the industry’s giving went to Republicans. Giving from coalmining
firms was even more lopsided, with 90 percent going to Republicans, according to
the Center for Responsive Politics.

The investment soon paid off. As the Harvard political scientist Theda Skocpol writes in
a study of climate change denial, the Republican Party, particularly in the U.S. Congress,
soon swung sharply to the right on climate issues. Partisan differences remained small
among the general public but grew into a gaping chasm among elected officials.

Conservative opponents of carbon regulations, like James Inhofe, a Republican senator
from Oklahoma who received serial campaign donations from Koch Industries PAC,
turned the rhetoric up to a boiling point. Global warming, he proclaimed, was “the greatest
hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.” Inhofe’s spokesman, Marc Morano, had a
reputation as a professional “pit bull,” as Mann later put it, derived from his earlier role
promoting the claims of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, a group that had smeared John
Kerry’s military record during his 2004 presidential campaign. At the time, Morano was
working for a conservative news outlet that was funded in part by the Scaife, Bradley, and
Olin Foundations.

By 2006, Morano had moved on to “swiftboating” scientists. “You’ve got to name
names and you’ve got to go after individuals,” he explained in an interview with the
documentary filmmaker Robert Kenner. He seemed to relish making political
disagreements personal, taunting and inflaming opponents with a grin in televised
showdowns. Morano denounced James Hansen as a “wannabe Unabomber” and Mann as
a “charlatan.” He said of the scapegoating, “We had a lot of fun with it.”

Morano charged that Mann was part of what he called “the ‘climate con,’ ” which he
described as “a lavishly funded climate machine that is lobbying for laws and uses every
bit of data or new study to proclaim ‘it’s worse than we thought’ or ‘we must act now.’ ”
Morano’s background was in political science, which he studied at George Mason
University, not climate science. “I’m not a scientist but I play one on TV,” he joked.
Nonetheless, he asserted authoritatively that “man-made global warming fears are a grand
political narrative, not science.”

The George W. Bush years, meanwhile, proved a bonanza for the fossil fuel industry,
which had thrown its weight behind his election. The coal industry in particular had
played a major role in delivering West Virginia’s five electoral votes to Bush in 2000,
sealing a victory that would have gone to Al Gore had he carried the formerly Democratic
state instead. “State political veterans and top White House staffers concur that it was
basically a coal-fired victory,” The Wall Street Journal wrote. The industry was lavishly
rewarded. Vice President Dick Cheney, a former CEO of the oil-field equipment and
services company Halliburton, personally took charge of energy policy. Bush had vowed
during the campaign to act on climate change by limiting greenhouse gas emissions, but
once in office Cheney countermanded him. In what Cheney’s biographer Barton Gellman
describes as a “case study in managing an errant boss,” Cheney shifted the
administration’s position to arguing that the science on global warming was
“inconclusive,” requiring “more scientific inquiry.”

The 2005 energy bill, which Hillary Clinton dubbed at the time the “Dick Cheney
Lobbyist Energy Bill,” offered enormous subsidies and tax breaks for fossil-fuel-intensive
companies. The Bush administration weakened regulations, for instance, on coal-fired
power plants. Taking a position that was eventually overturned by the courts, it exempted
mercury emissions from regulation under the Clean Air Act, reversing the position taken
by the Clinton administration. Fracking got a boost too. Cheney used his influence to
exempt it from regulation under the Safe Drinking Water Act, over objections from the
Environmental Protection Agency. The fracking industry boomed. Within five years,
Devon Energy, Larry Nichols’s company, would rank as the fourth-largest producer of
natural gas in the United States. Harold Hamm would become a multibillionaire. Cheney’s
former company Halliburton also became a major player in the fracking industry,
illustrating that free-market advocates greatly benefited from government favors.

In all, the Bush energy act contained some $6 billion in oil and gas subsidies and $9
billion in coal subsidies. The Kochs routinely cast themselves as libertarians who deplored
government taxes, regulations, and subsidies, but records show they took full advantage of
the special tax credits and subsidies available to the oil, ethanol, and pipeline business,
among other areas of commerce in which they were engaged. In many cases, their
lobbyists fought hard to protect these perks. In addition, their companies benefited from
nearly $100 million in government contracts in the decade after 2000, according to a study
by Media Matters, a liberal watchdog group.

When Barack Obama took office, the fossil fuel industry was not only eager to preserve
its perks but also more militant in its opposition to climate change science than ever.
Skocpol notes that 2007 had been a turning point in the fight. That year, Al Gore was
awarded both a Nobel Peace Prize and featured in an Academy Award–winning
documentary film, An Inconvenient Truth. The film featured Mann’s hockey stick graph.
Gore’s acclaim and Mann’s simple chart helped raise concern about global warming to a
new peak, with 41 percent of the American public saying it worried them “a great deal.”

“At this critical juncture—when Americans in general might have been persuaded of
the urgency of dealing with global warming,” Skocpol notes, opponents fought back with
new vigor. The whole ideological assembly line that Richard Fink and Charles Koch had
envisioned decades earlier, including the entire conservative media sphere, was enlisted in
the fight. Fox Television and conservative talk radio hosts gave saturation coverage to the
issue, portraying climate scientists as swindlers pushing a radical, partisan, and antiAmerican
agenda. Allied think tanks pumped out books and position papers, whose
authors testified in Congress and appeared on a whirlwind tour of talk shows. “Climate
denial got disseminated deliberately and rapidly from think tank tomes to the daily media
fare of about thirty to forty percent of the U.S. populace,” Skocpol estimates.
Climate contrarians also recruited conservative evangelical Christian leaders, who
distrusted government in general and had impressive political and communications clout.

One by-product of this pact was an organization in the Washington suburbs called the
Cornwall Alliance, which released a hit film in evangelical circles called Resisting the
Green Dragon that equated environmentalism with worship of a false god. It described
global warming as “one of the greatest deceptions of our day.” Climate change became
such a hot-button issue for Christian fundamentalists that Richard Cizik, a vice president
of the National Association of Evangelicals, who was considered among the most
powerful leaders in the movement, was forced to resign in late 2008 after publicly
endorsing climate change science.

Before long, public opinion polls showed that concern about climate change among all
but hard-core liberals had collapsed. As the 2008 presidential campaign played out, the
issue grew increasingly polarized. Just before the election, with the economy in tumult,
John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate, reiterated that the climate problem
was real. He also said that green jobs would lead the way to economic recovery. But his
choice of Sarah Palin as his running mate, one of whose mantras was “Drill, Baby, Drill,”
indicated just how influential the voice of climate extremism was becoming within the
Republican Party.

As Obama took office, America derived over 85 percent of its total energy from oil, gas,
and coal. The business was enormous, with profits and influence to match.
Conventional wisdom nonetheless held that Obama’s election portended well for
environmentalists. Mann, too, was optimistic, but he worried about what he regarded as a
“troubling complacency” among his colleagues. He knew that the Obama administration
posed two huge threats to the fossil fuel industry, and he doubted the industry would just
roll over. The first threat was Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency. Lisa Jackson,
the EPA administrator, announced that she intended to treat greenhouse gas emissions as
hazardous pollutants, regulating them for the first time under the Clean Air Act. It was an
authority that the Supreme Court had upheld in 2007. But no previous administration had
tried to take on the industry so frontally. The second was the Democrats’ plan to introduce
the long-incubating cap-and-trade bill to limit greenhouse gas emissions.

—

Even before Obama was inaugurated, Americans for Prosperity had begun taking aim at
the cap-and-trade idea, circulating a pledge requiring elected officials to oppose new
spending to fight climate change. Koch Industries, meanwhile, began lobbying against
government mandates to reduce carbon emissions. Then, soon after Obama was
inaugurated, an odd television ad popped up around the country that seemed strangely off
message. While most Americans were transfixed by the unfolding economic disaster that
was preoccupying the Obama administration in its first few months, out of nowhere, it
seemed, was a discordant television spot about a spoiled slacker named Carlton.
“Hey there,” said a louche-looking young man, plucking away at a plate of canapés.
“I’m Carlton, the wealthy eco-hypocrite. I inherited my money and attended fancy
schools. I own three homes and five cars, but always talk with my rich friends about
saving the planet. And I want Congress to spend billions on programs in the name of
global warming and green energy, even if it causes massive unemployment, higher energy
bills, and digs people like you even deeper into the recession. Who knows? Maybe I’ll
even make money off of it!”

“Carlton” was, in fact, the creation of Americans for Prosperity, the nonprofit “social
welfare” group founded and heavily funded by David Koch, who of course had inherited
hundreds of millions of dollars, attended Deerfield Academy, owned four homes (a ski
lodge in Aspen; a Belle Epoque mansion, Villa el Sarmiento, in Palm Beach; a sprawling
beach house in the Hamptons; and an eighteen-room duplex at 740 Park Avenue in
Manhattan), and drove, among other cars, a Land Rover and a Ferrari.

By creating “Carlton” as a decoy, the Kochs and their allies evidently hoped to convince
the public that government action on climate change posed a threat to “people like you” or
ordinary Americans’ pocketbooks. But it of course posed a far greater threat to their own.
With ownership of refineries, pipelines, a coal subsidiary (the C. Reiss Coal Company),
coal-fired power plants, fertilizer, petroleum coke manufacturing, timber, and leases on
over a million acres of untapped Canadian oil sands, Koch Industries alone routinely
released some 300 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere a year. Any
financial penalty that the government placed on carbon pollution would threaten both their
immediate profit margins and the long-term value of the enormous investments they had
in still-untapped fossil fuel reserves.

The Kochs themselves said little about their views on climate change at the time.
But in one interview, David Koch suggested that if real, it would prove a boon. “The
Earth will be able to support enormously more people because a far greater land area will
be available to produce food,” he argued. Charles’s thinking was reflected in the
company’s in-house newsletter, which featured an article titled “Blowing Smoke.” “Why
are such unproven or false claims promoted?” it asked. Rather than fighting global
warming, the newsletter suggested, mankind would be better off adapting to it. “Since we
can’t control Mother Nature, let’s figure out how to get along with her changes,” it
advised. A similar line was subtly argued in the David H. Koch Hall of Human Origins at
the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History in Washington, which opened in
March 2010. The message of the exhibition, funded by his fortune, was that the human
race had evolved for the better in response to previous environmental challenges and
would adapt in the face of climate change, too. An interactive game suggested that if the
climate on earth became intolerable, people might build “underground cities” and develop
“short, compact bodies” or “curved spines” so that “moving around in tight spaces will be
no problem.”

Soon the climate issue was creeping into Tea Party rallies, too. As protesters erupted in
generalized rage in the spring and summer of 2009, Americans for Prosperity,
FreedomWorks, and the other secretly funded Tea Party groups succeeded to a remarkable
extent in channeling the populist anger into the climate fight. At the first big “Tax Day”
Tea Party rallies on April 15, 2009, while most protesters were flaying Obama’s bank
bailouts and stimulus plan, the staff of Americans for Prosperity handed out free T-shirts
and signs protesting what would ordinarily seem to be an arcane issue for most people in
the streets, the cap-and-trade bill. “The Obama budget proposes the largest excise tax in
history,” the advocacy group’s talking points stressed.

To dramatize the issue, offshoots of Americans for Prosperity sent “Carbon Cops,” who
pranced into Tea Party rallies pretending to be overreaching emissaries from the EPA,
warning that backyard barbecues, churches, and lawn mowers were about to be shut down
because of new, stricter interpretations of the Clean Air Act. The advocacy group also
launched what it called the Cost of Hot Air Tour to mock the cap-and-trade proposal. It
featured a seventy-foot-tall bright red hot-air balloon on whose side was emblazoned a
slogan reducing the argument against the cap-and-trade proposal to six scary words. Cap
and trade, it said, means “higher taxes, lost jobs, less freedom.” Americans for Prosperity
sent the balloon to so many states in 2009 that the group’s president, Tim Phillips, later
admitted, “I rode more hot-air balloons in that year-and-a-half period than I ever want to
ride again. I do not like hot-air balloons.”

The public campaign was accompanied by a darker covert one. Tom Perriello, a
freshman Democratic congressman from Charlottesville, Virginia, who favored the capand-trade
bill, discovered this in the summer of 2009 when constituents started
bombarding his office with angry missives. Reams of faxes arrived from voters, many
representing local chapters of ordinarily supportive liberal groups like the NAACP and the
American Association of University Women. Under official letterheads, they argued
passionately that the cap-and-trade legislation would raise electric bills, hurting the poor.
But an effort by the congressman’s staff to reach the angry constituents revealed that the
letters were forgeries, sent on behalf of a coal industry trade group by Bonner and
Associates, a Washington-based public relations firm.

After the fraud was exposed, the firm fired an employee. But it wasn’t an isolated
incident. Perriello, like many other elected officials that summer, also found himself
heckled during town hall meetings. One such heckler called him a “traitor” for supporting
the cap-and-trade bill, while another videotaped the showdown. Later one of the disruptive
members of the audience admitted to the investigative reporter Lee Fang that he had been
put up to it by the Virginia director of Americans for Prosperity. Similar outbursts took
place all over the country that summer. Mike Castle, a moderate Republican congressman
from Delaware, was accosted by voters demanding to know how he could even consider
voting for such a “hoax,” according to Eric Pooley’s account in The Climate War. The
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Petroleum Institute, and other industry
representatives, it turned out, had created a “grassroots” group called Energy Citizens that
joined Tea Party organizations in packing the town halls with protesters.

Fanning the flames were the right-wing radio hosts. “It’s not about saving the planet,”
Rush Limbaugh told his audience. “It’s not about anything, folks, other than raising taxes
and redistributing wealth.” Glenn Beck warned listeners it would lead to water rationing.

“This is about controlling every part of your life, even taking a shower!” Torquing up the
fear, Republicans in Congress quoted from a study by the Heritage Foundation that
predicted it would add thousands of dollars to Americans’ energy bills and lead to
devastating unemployment. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office put out an
authoritative study contradicting this, demonstrating that the average cost to Americans
would be the same as buying a postage stamp a day. But John Boehner, the Republican
minority leader in the House, dismissed the real numbers, suggesting anyone who believed
them could “go ask the unicorns.”

Despite the inflammatory atmosphere, the House passed a bill to cap and trade carbon
dioxide emissions on June 26, 2009. The process wasn’t pretty. It took an extraordinary
push from its sponsors, Congressmen Henry Waxman of California and Ed Markey of
Massachusetts, and an epic amount of horse-trading between environmentalists and the
affected industries. Many environmentalists thought the final product was so flawed that it
wasn’t worth the trouble. But for those looking for Congress to reach the kind of moderate
compromises Obama had been elected to deliver, it was a first step.

Rather than causing elation, though, the victory was clouded by trepidation. Supporters,
particularly Democrats from conservative, fossil-fuel-heavy states like Perriello and Rick
Boucher of Virginia, feared there would be a steep price to pay. As the threat to the
industry grew, so would its determination to stop them.

That fall, television ads began appearing in states like Montana, where the Democratic
senator Max Baucus was already under attack from members of the Koch network on the
health-care issue. “There is no scientific evidence that CO2 is a pollutant. In fact higher CO2 levels than we have today would help the Earth’s ecosystems,” the ads said, urging viewers to tell Baucus not to vote for the cap-and-trade bill, which would “cost us jobs.”
The sponsor for the ad was a group curiously called CO2 Is Green. Quietly funding it, according to Steven Mufson, the energy reporter for The Washington Post, was Corbin Robertson, owner of the country’s largest private cache of coal.

Robertson’s fingerprints were detectable behind another anti-climate-change front
group, too, the Coalition for Responsible Regulation. As soon as Obama’s EPA took steps
to regulate greenhouse gases, the previously unknown group took legal action to stop it.
The group’s private e-mails surfaced later, revealing how it successfully egged on Texas’s
bureaucrats to join the lawsuit, despite the state’s own climatologist’s belief that manmade
global warming posed a real danger and that the EPA’s scientific findings were solid.
Neither Robertson’s name nor that of his company appeared in the papers incorporating
the organization. But its address and its top officers were the same as those of Robertson’s
company, Quintana.

Following hard on the summer’s raucous Tea Party protests, things got uglier in
Washington as well. As Obama addressed a joint session of Congress laying out his
health-care proposal in September 2009, his speech was interrupted by Joe Wilson, a
Republican congressman from South Carolina, shouting, “You lie!” from the well of the
House. Congress rebuked Wilson for his extraordinary breach of decorum, but within a
month, climate skeptics were echoing Wilson’s belligerence. One posted a report titled
“UN Climate Reports: They Lie!”

—

The opposition grew as the Obama administration got ready to head to Copenhagen in
December 2009 for its first international climate summit. World leaders expected the
United States would finally commit to serious reform. Previously, the United States had
declined to join other developed nations in agreeing to limit greenhouse gas emissions
under the Kyoto Protocol. Given Obama’s position, time seemed to be running out for the
fossil fuel forces and their free-market allies. Then, on November 17, 2009, an anonymous
commenter on a contrarian Web site declared, “A miracle has happened.”

With lethal timing, an unidentified saboteur had hacked expertly into the University of
East Anglia’s Web site and uploaded thousands of internal e-mails detailing the private
communications of the scientists working in its famed Climatic Research Unit. The
climatologists at the British university had been in constant communication with those in
America, and now all of their unguarded professional doubts, along with their unguarded
and sometimes contemptuous asides about their opponents, stretching all the way back to
1996, were visible for the entire world to read.

Chris Horner, a conservative climate contrarian working at the Competitive Enterprise
Institute, another pro-corporate think tank subsidized by oil and other fossil fuel fortunes,
including the Kochs’, declared, “The blue dress moment may have arrived.” But instead of
using Monica Lewinsky’s telltale garment to impeach Bill Clinton, they would use the
words of the world’s leading climate scientists to impeach the climate change movement.
If edited down and taken out of context, their exchanges could be made to appear to
suggest a willingness to falsify data in order to buttress the idea that global warming was
real.

Dubbing the alleged scandal Climategate, they went into overdrive. The web of
organizations, funded in part by the Kochs, pounced on the hacked e-mails. Cato scholars
were particularly energetic in promoting the story. In the two weeks after the e-mails went
public, one Cato scholar alone gave more than twenty media interviews trumpeting the
alleged scandal. The story soon spread from obviously slanted venues to the pages of The
New York Times and The Washington Post, adding mainstream credence. Tim Phillips, the
president of Americans for Prosperity, jumped on the hacked e-mails, describing them to a
gathering of conservative bloggers at the Heritage Foundation as “a crucial tipping point”
and adding, “If we win the science argument, I think it’s game, set, and match for them.”

Eventually, seven independent inquiries exonerated the climate scientists, finding
nothing in the e-mails to discredit their work or the larger consensus on global warming.
In the meantime, though, Michael Mann’s life, along with the environmental movement,
was plunged into turmoil.

Mann was among the scientists most roiled by the mysterious hacking incident. Four
words in the purloined e-mails were seized upon as evidence that he was a fraud. In
describing his research, his colleagues had praised his use of a “trick” that had helped him
“hide the decline.” Mann’s detractors leaped to the conclusion that these words proved
that his research was just a “trick” to fool the public and that he had deliberately hidden an
actual “decline” in twentieth-century temperatures in order to fake evidence of global
warming.

The facts, when fully understood, were very different. It was a British colleague, not
Mann, who had written the ostensibly damning words, and when examined in context,
they were utterly mundane. The “trick” referred to was just a clever technique Mann had
devised in order to provide a backup data set. The “decline” in question was a reference to
a decline in available information from certain kinds of tree rings after 1961, which had
made it hard to have a consistent set of data. Another scientist, not Mann, had found an
alternative source of data to compensate for this problem, which was what was meant by
“hide the decline.” The only genuinely negative disclosure from the e-mails was that
Mann and the other climatologists had agreed among themselves to withhold, rather than
share, their research with some of their critics, whom they disparaged. Given the
harassment they had been subjected to, their reasoning was understandable, but it violated
the customary transparency expected within the scientific community. Other than that, the
“Climategate” scandal was, in other words, not one.

It took no time, nevertheless, for the hacked e-mails to spur a witch hunt. Within days,
Inhofe and other Republicans in Congress who were recipients of Koch campaign
donations demanded an investigation into Mann. They sent threatening letters to Penn
State, where he was by then a tenured professor. Later, Virginia’s attorney general, Ken
Cuccinelli, a graduate of the George Mason School of Law, would also subpoena Mann’s
former employer, the University of Virginia, demanding all records relating to his decadeold
academic research, regardless of libertarians’ professed concerns about government
intrusion. Eventually, Virginia’s Supreme Court dismissed its own attorney general’s case
“with prejudice,” finding he had misread the law.

By New Year’s Eve 2009, Mann was feeling under attack from all sides. Conservative
talk radio hosts lambasted him regularly. Contrarian Web sites were lit up with blog posts
detailing his iniquity. A self-described former CIA officer contacted colleagues in Mann’s
department offering a $10,000 reward to any who would provide dirt on him,
“confidentiality assured.” Soon after, Mann asserts, a think tank called the National Center
for Public Policy Research led a campaign to get Mann’s National Science Foundation
grants revoked. As Mann recounts in his book The Hockey Stick and the Climate Wars,
two conservative nonprofit law firms, the Southeastern Legal Foundation and the
Landmark Legal Foundation, brought legal actions aimed at him. The think tank and the
two law firms were funded by combinations of the same small constellation of family
fortunes through their private charitable foundations. Omnipresent were Bradley, Olin, and
Scaife.

Charles Koch’s foundation also was engaged in piling on. It helped subsidize the
Landmark Legal Foundation. The Kochs evidently admired Landmark’s president, Mark
Levin, a longtime associate of the former attorney general Edwin Meese III. In 2010,
Americans for Prosperity hired Levin to promote it on his nationally syndicated talk radio
show, thereby copying the deal that FreedomWorks had struck with Glenn Beck. Levin
was a curious choice of spokesman for the buttoned-down, erudite Koch brothers. His
style was incendiary, even rude. He later called Kenneth Vogel, the Politico reporter who
broke the news of the deal with Americans for Prosperity, “a vicious S.O.B.” and told a
female caller, “I don’t know why your husband doesn’t put a gun to his temple. Get the
Hell out of here!” His attacks on Obama’s policies were similarly heated, particularly
regarding climate change. He said Mann “and the other advocates of man-made global
warming” did not “know how to conduct a correct statistical analysis” and accused
“enviro-statists” of inventing global warming in order to justify a tyrannical government
takeover. Their “pursuit,” he claimed, “after all, is power, not truth.”

An especially grave attack on Mann’s livelihood was launched, meanwhile, by yet
another group, the Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives in
Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The self-described think tank belonged to a national web of
similar conservative organizations known as the State Policy Network. Much of
Commonwealth’s financial support came through DonorsTrust and Donors Capital Fund,
making it impossible to identify the individual backers. But because it was based in
Scaife’s home state, Commonwealth had particularly deep ties to his family foundations.
Michael Gleba, the chair of Commonwealth’s board of directors, was also the president of
the Sarah Scaife Foundation and treasurer of Scaife’s Carthage Foundation and a trustee of
both. This arrangement gave Commonwealth unusual clout, particularly over
Pennsylvania’s state legislature.

The Pennsylvania think tank waged a campaign to get Mann fired and successfully
lobbied Republican allies in the legislature to threaten to withhold Penn State’s funding
until the university took “appropriate action” against Mann. With the public university’s
finances held hostage, it agreed to investigate Mann. Meanwhile, the think tank ran a
campaign of attack ads against him in the university’s daily newspaper, as well as helping
to organize an anti-Mann campus protest.

“It was nerve-racking to be under that pressure at Penn State,” recalls Mann. “There
were these nebulous accusations based on stolen e-mails. Ordinarily, it would have been
clear there were no grounds for investigation. But it was promoted by the Commonwealth
Foundation, which seems to almost have a stranglehold on Republicans in the state
legislature. I knew I had done nothing wrong, but there was this uncertain future hanging
over me. There was so much political pressure being brought to bear on Penn State I
wasn’t sure if they’d cave.”

In the meantime, death threats began appearing in Mann’s inbox. “I tried to shield my
family as much as I could,” he says. But this became impossible when one day he opened
a suspicious-looking letter without thinking, only to have it release a cloud of white
powder into his office. Fearing anthrax, he called the campus police. Soon the FBI
quarantined his office behind crime tape, disrupting the whole department. The powder
turned out to be harmless, but, Mann recalls, “it was a spectacle. There was a point where
I had the hotline number for the chief of police on our fridge, in case my wife saw
anything unusual. It felt like there was a very calibrated campaign of vilification to the
extent where the crazies might go after us.”

It was particularly disturbing to Mann that there appeared to be overlap between hardcore
climate change deniers and Second Amendment enthusiasts, whipped up, he came to
believe, by “cynical special interests.” Mann says, “The disaffected, the people who have
trouble putting dinner on the table, were being misled into believing that action on climate
change meant that ‘They’ want to take away your freedom and probably your guns, too.
There was a very skillful campaign to indoctrinate them,” he said. “We’ve seen Second
Amendment enthusiasts take action against abortion doctors. There’s an attempt to paint
us as villains in the same way.”

He was not alone in receiving death threats. Several climatologists, he said, including
Phil Jones, director of the hacked Climatic Research Unit in Great Britain, felt compelled
to hire personal bodyguards. “Luckily,” Mann relates, both the Penn State investigations—
which the legislature required to be done a second time in greater depth—and another one
by the inspector general of the National Science Foundation, essentially the highest
scientific body in the United States, exonerated Mann. “It lasted two years. It came out
well. But two years is a long time,” he says. “I never imagined I’d be at the center of some
contentious debate. It’s not why you study what I did. What worries me,” he adds, “is that
this circus-like atmosphere may have scared off many young scientists. It actually has a
chilling effect. It prevents scientists from participating in the public discourse, because
they fear they, or their department head, will be threatened.”

By the time Mann’s scientific research was upheld, underscoring his integrity as well as
the genuine danger posed by climate change, it hardly mattered. By then, the percentage of
Americans who believed the world was warming had dropped a precipitous fourteen
points from 2008. Almost half of those polled by Gallup in 2010—48 percent—believed
that fears of global warming were “generally exaggerated,” the highest numbers since the
polling firm first posed the question more than a decade before. Watching from afar, Mann
could see no cause for the United States to move in the opposite direction from science
other than money. “In the scientific community, the degree of confidence in climate
change is rising,” he said. “In the public, it’s either steady or falling. There’s a divergence.
That wedge is what the industry has bought.”

—

Although the cap-and-trade bill moved to the Senate, it was already dead. At first,
Lindsey Graham, the independent-minded Republican from South Carolina, took a
courageous leadership role in the fight, offering to co-sponsor the legislation with the
Democrat John Kerry and the Independent Joe Lieberman after declaring, to the surprise
and delight of environmentalists, “I have come to conclude that greenhouse gases and
carbon pollution” are “not a good thing.”

Graham, however, feared pressure from his right flank. He warned the Democrats that
they had to move fast, before Fox News caught wind of the process. As he feared, in April
2010, Fox News attacked him for backing a “gas tax.” A vitriolic Tea Party activist
immediately held a press conference in his home state denouncing him as “gay,” and a
political front group called American Solutions launched a negative campaign against him
for his climate stance in South Carolina. American Solutions, it later turned out, was
funded by huge fossil fuel and other corporate interests, many of whom were in the Koch
fold. Among them were Larry Nichols of Devon Energy, Dick Farmer of Cintas, Stan
Hubbard of Hubbard Broadcasting, and Sheldon Adelson, chairman of the Las Vegas
Sands Corporation. Within days of the drubbing, Graham withdrew from the process.
Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader from Nevada, dealt the final blow to the capand-trade
bill. Facing a tough reelection himself and worried about making Democrats
walk the plank for the bill, he refused after Graham backed out to bring the legislation to
the Senate floor for a vote.

Opponents of climate change reform got their wish. “Gridlock is the greatest friend a
global warming skeptic has, because that’s all you really want,” Morano later
acknowledged. “There’s no legislation we’re championing. We’re the negative force. We
are just trying to stop stuff.”

Asked why the climate legislation failed, Al Gore told The New Yorker’s Ryan Lizza,
“The influence of special interests is now at an extremely unhealthy level. It’s at a point,”
he said, “where it’s virtually impossible for participants in the current political system to
enact any significant change without first seeking and gaining permission from the largest
commercial interests who are most affected by the proposed change.”

As the first legislation aimed at addressing climate change sputtered out, the Massey
mine in West Virginia collapsed in a methane explosion, killing twenty-nine miners. Soon
after, a leak from the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico triggered the largest
accidental oil spill in history, killing and causing birth defects in record numbers of marine
animals. A grand jury would charge the owner of the Upper Big Branch mine with
criminally conspiring to evade safety regulations, while a federal judge would find the oil
rig’s principal owner, British Petroleum, guilty of gross negligence and reckless conduct.

Meanwhile, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was already above the
level that scientists said risked causing runaway global warming. Obama acknowledged at
this point that he knew “the votes may not be there right now,” but, he vowed, “I intend to
find them in the coming months.” The conservative money machine, however, was
already far ahead of him on an audacious new plan to try to ensure that he would never
succeed.

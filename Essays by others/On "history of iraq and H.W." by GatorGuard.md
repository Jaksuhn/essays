Oh fuck right off with the propaganda. Do not try to pretend this man is anything less than a war criminal.

Edit: Had a few comments ask to elaborate. I will have to discuss the history of Iraq.

In 1958, an anti-imperialist, anti-monarchical coup called the [14 July Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/14_July_Revolution) took place in the Iraq government, installing a socialist government primarily under the Ba'ath Party. This new leadership began redistributing land from its few rich holders to the public, improving education, healthcare, infrastructure, etc., in accordance with socialist principles.

General Abd al-Karim Qasim, the man who assumed rule after the revolution, was discredited for lacking [Pan Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Arabism) views -- he didn't want every Arab country to unite, in other words. He aligned himself with the Iraqi Communist Party, an opponent of the Ba'ath Party which was against Pan Arabism. An assassination was attempted on him by the Ba'ath party. Leading the coup, due to the Ba'ath Party primarily being intellectuals without military experience, was Saddam Hussein, who was not inexperienced with warfare. The attempt in 1959 failed, and while Saddam became iconic for leading it, he was exiled for a time.

In 1963, he returned to the country after a successful coup by the Ba'ath Party, and managed to build up power as a figurehead again until 1966, when then-president Abdul Salam Harif died in a plane crash. Another weak presidency for a couple years was usurped by Saddam with a bloodless coup in 1968, which installed Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr as President; however, Saddam was the major driving force behind policy change throughout al-Bakr's rule. 

Now we have to talk about Saddam's legacy. I'm going to defer to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein):

>"After the Ba'athists took power in 1968, Saddam focused on attaining stability in a nation riddled with profound tensions. Long before Saddam, Iraq had been split along social, ethnic, religious, and economic fault lines: Sunni versus Shi'ite, Arab versus Kurd, tribal chief versus urban merchant, nomad versus peasant.[47] The desire for stable rule in a country rife with factionalism led Saddam to pursue both massive repression and the improvement of living standards.[47]

>Saddam actively fostered the modernization of the Iraqi economy along with the creation of a strong security apparatus to prevent coups within the power structure and insurrections apart from it. Ever concerned with broadening his base of support among the diverse elements of Iraqi society and mobilizing mass support, he closely followed the administration of state welfare and development programs.

>At the center of this strategy was Iraq's oil. On 1 June 1972, Saddam oversaw the seizure of international oil interests, which, at the time, dominated the country's oil sector. A year later, world oil prices rose dramatically as a result of the 1973 energy crisis, and skyrocketing revenues enabled Saddam to expand his agenda. 

>Within just a few years, Iraq was providing social services that were unprecedented among Middle Eastern countries. Saddam established and controlled the "National Campaign for the Eradication of Illiteracy" and the campaign for "Compulsory Free Education in Iraq," and largely under his auspices, the government established universal free schooling up to the highest education levels; hundreds of thousands learned to read in the years following the initiation of the program. The government also supported families of soldiers, granted free hospitalization to everyone, and gave subsidies to farmers. Iraq created one of the most modernized public-health systems in the Middle East, earning Saddam an award from the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).[48][49]

>With the help of increasing oil revenues, Saddam diversified the largely oil-based Iraqi economy. Saddam implemented a national infrastructure campaign that made great progress in building roads, promoting mining, and developing other industries. The campaign helped Iraq's energy industries. Electricity was brought to nearly every city in Iraq, and many outlying areas. Before the 1970s, most of Iraq's people lived in the countryside and roughly two-thirds were peasants. This number would decrease quickly during the 1970s as global oil prices helped revenues to rise from less than a half billion dollars to tens of billions of dollars and the country invested into industrial expansion. "

tl;dr: Saddam made great progress for his country domestically, on the back of Oil. The oil, despite its value in creating the nation he sought, would eventually be his regime and his country's downfall.

Saddam sought the Soviet Union as an ally in 1972 and signed a 15-year treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with them. In 1979, when al-Bakr was readying retirement, he was considering uniting with Syria (in line with a Pan Arabic movement). However, Saddam did not want to be cast to obscurity while the president of Syria, Hafez al-Assad, assumed control of both nations. So he forced al-Bakr to retire and assumed the presidency on July 16, 1979.

So at this point, hopefully you're getting the idea that Saddam is getting a little paranoid.

Next door, in Iran, the [Iranian Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution) had just occurred, in a push against the U.S.-friendly government. With this loss, the U.S. was desperately seeking an ally in the middle east because of its oil interests. The newly installed Iranian government called for deposition of all dictatorships in Islam nations -- which included Iraq.

In what became known as the [Iran-Iraq war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War), instigated by Iraq with encouragement from the U.S., the two nations fought brutally. In 1982, after several decisive and catastrophic defeats of the Iraqis by the Iranians, it seemed like Iran would win, but then the U.S. ended it's policy of 'neutrality'. Reagan signed a National Security Decision Directive which determined: "The United States could not afford to allow Iraq to lose the war to Iran." So Saddam started [taking money and supplies, among other things, from the U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_support_for_Iraq_during_the_Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_war) to fight its neighbor.  The U.S.'s involvement secured the Iraqi victory in 1988, and cemented the U.S. as an ally to Saddam.

George H.W. Bush was the U.S. Vice President from 1980-1988, so he has become involved in Iraq significantly at this point. When elected president in 1989, he clearly stated U.S. reasoning for allying with Iraq: "[President Bush signed NSD 26, which begins, "Access to Persian Gulf oil and the security of key friendly states in the area are vital to U.S. national security." With respect to Iraq, the directive stated, "Normal relations between the United States and Iraq would serve our longer term interests and promote stability in both the Persian Gulf and the Middle East."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_support_for_Iraq_during_the_Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_war#Longer_term_interests)".

Now, Saddam had received support from other anti-Iranian countries, including [Oil-rich neighbor Kuwait](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein#Tensions_with_Kuwait), which had loaned $30 billion dollars to him. He requested they forgive the debt, which they refused. Saddam pushed for oil-producing countries to raise global oil prices by cutting back production; Kuwait refused. Iraq invaded.

The U.S., the greatest consumer of Oil in the world, was deeply worried about this. Saddam had also threatened to destroy Israel, a significant U.S. ally in the region (which we now know is an apartheid state that should never have been placed in the Middle East). Saddam had earned U.S. ire.

>"U.S. President George H. W. Bush responded cautiously for the first several days. On one hand, Kuwait, prior to this point, had been a virulent enemy of Israel and was the Persian Gulf monarchy that had the most friendly relations with the Soviets.[93] On the other hand, Washington foreign policymakers, along with Middle East experts, military critics, and firms heavily invested in the region, were extremely concerned with stability in this region.[94] The invasion immediately triggered fears that the world's price of oil, and therefore control of the world economy, was at stake."

So the U.S., concerned about its oil, allied with 35 nations in issuing a proclamation that Saddam had to leave Kuwait. Saddam did not.

>"[For 42 consecutive days and nights, the coalition forces subjected Iraq to one of the most intensive air bombardments in military history. The coalition flew over 100,000 sorties, dropping 88,500 tons of bombs,[106] and widely destroying military and civilian infrastructure."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War#Air_campaign)

In retaliation for threatening U.S. oil interests, George H.W. Bush authorized the total destruction of Iraq. He bombed them back to the fucking stone age. Our ground troops were a formality, a means to let the suriving Iraqis surrender. 

A country which once had electricity and water available to all; hospitals renowned in the region for their care; virtually free healthcare and education for all; inexpensive, nutritious, and abundant food; and strong infrastructure ranging from highways to dams to telephone systems; became nothing. [The people we hurt most with our indiscriminate and total bombing were, of course, the civilian populous.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War#Coalition_bombing_of_Iraq's_civilian_infrastructure)


**Extreme tl;dr, George H.W. Bush had numerous civilian targets bombed intentionally in response to a former ally in the middle east attempting to control oil interests.** This is in-line with the U.S.'s violent militaristic imperialist history, of which Bush was a supporter.

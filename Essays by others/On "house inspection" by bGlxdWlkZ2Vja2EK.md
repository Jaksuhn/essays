Thanks for the suggestions and updates everybody. This ended up expanding over 2x the initial size! I got great feedback and interesting comments from a ton of different people, and I learned a ton about how homes and home construction works in area I knew nothing about before!

As a note: This is not intended to replace a good home inspection. Its intended to be something you can use when looking at the house for the first time. This will help you not fall in love with a house only to find out after great expense that it has huge issues.

Layout:

* Be wary of staging (the furniture/decorations that are in the house when you see it). Often times smaller stuff will be used to make rooms look bigger than they are. Take a tape measure, and have a list of the sizes of the stuff you own just so you can visualize yourself.
* Pay attention to ports, outlets, thermostats, windows etc. If putting your bed in the corner will cover the thermostat you will be annoyed, or if there are no outlets in the corner where you want to put the TV you will end up with cables all over the floor. etc.
* Pay attention to what is behind or around the room you are looking at. If its over the garage you will hear the garage door opener and it will be loud. If its near the kitchen it will smell like food, and be hot in the summer when cooking.
* Dual zone AC? This is important if its two story since the upstairs will be hot without it (heat rises.) Look for thermostats. Ideally there is 1 or more per level.
* Rooms on the front of the house will hear street noise (cars going by, children playing, etc). Which rooms face the front?
* Extensions. If a part of the house looks like it doesn’t “belong”, i.e. the doorway in could have been a wall and the whole extra part could have not existed then be careful. Often times extensions can “corrupt” the construction of the original house. For example, they can screw up drainage, cause leaks in the seams with the roof, or generally just weaker construction. Make sure you look up who built the house, and who did the extension, and also verify that the work was permitted and done to code by contacting the city or county code division. (h/t /u/ed_merckx)
* Converted garage? If there is a front room that seems like it is right where the garage should have been it might be a converted room. These are often drafty rooms that have really hard floors and can be strangely noisy due to the household equipment like water heaters or furnaces hidden in them.
* House backs up to a business? You are going to hear cars coming and going as well as trucks loading and unloading.
* West facing rooms will get lots of light at sunrise, bad for bedrooms, good for breakfast nooks. Rooms that face west will get lots of light at sunset, bad if a TV will be anywhere near this situation when you come home from work. North facing rooms will get no direct sunlight at all so they will be cold in winter, but South facing rooms will get full sun in summer which will make them hot.

Electrical:

* Smoke detectors? They are required, but newer houses wire them in so that they all go off during a fire. This is ideal as it means less battery replacements and better alerting. If you test one do they all go off? Houses older than the 90’s will not have this feature.
* GFP in bathrooms, near sinks? This is a sign of modern electrical wiring. Note that in some houses the ground fault system may also be in the circuit breaker panel. Look for breakers with a “reset” button on them. (h/t /u/Chango_El_Maestro)
* 2 prong outlets? This is a sign of old wiring which can cause problems and make it hard to plug various things in.
* Circuit breaker’s properly labeled? This will just save you time when you need to power things down and generally indicates that the previous owner maintained things.
* Is the house wired for ceiling fans? If there are two switches and one does nothing while the other turns on a overhead light the house might already be wired for ceiling fans and one has just not been installed yet. (h/t GearsPoweredFool)
* Check the breaker panel. Is there room for expansion? This can be good if you plan on adding anything over time (electric car port for example). Not a deal breaker but additions can get expensive.
* If any wall outlets move when trying to plug anything in then they are improperly and could be a few hundred dollars to have an electrician fix. They might also pose a fire risk. (h/t /u/shea241)

Appliances:

* Be wary of older appliances. Even if they work now they will break and when they do they will be expensive. Appliances over 10 years will likely need replaced soon so this needs to be factored into the cost.
* If there are high end appliances make sure to ask if they are staying. Home owners love to show a house with a nest thermostat, nice water softener, etc only to replace them with lower end models when they actually move out. (h/t /u/Useful-ldiot)

Siding:

* Wood, Vinyl, Metal? These will last varying amounts of time before being replaced. Wood needs painted and maintained every 5-10 years. Vinyl doesn’t need painted (and can’t be) but lasts much longer, 30 years is common. Metal lasts even longer, and typically doesn’t need painted either.
* Rot, paint chipping, etc? This can be a sign of things happening behind the siding.

Roofing:
* If you can see tar under shingles then a repair has been made. If done badly these can leak and cause issues. (h/t /u/68carguy)
* If singles are bowed, pulled up, falling off, etc then this is not good either. This may be a sign that the roof will need replaced right away which can be expensive. (h/t /u/68carguy)
* If you see small round sections on the shingles this could be bails under the shingle popping out. This can indicate leaking and rotting in the rafters which is bad and expensive to fix. (h/t /u/68carguy)
* Look around the neighborhood. Most houses will have been built about the same time and if some appear to have newer roofs then its a sign that the house you are looking at might need replacing soon as well. (h/t /u/admiralkit)
* Check the gutters? Are they clean? If not it might be a sign of improper maintenance from the current owner. (h/t /u/hammertonail)

Water:

* Low pressure at a sink, or shower? Check all the sinks.
* Try filling sinks by putting a couple of inches of water in them and then letting them drain. If they don’t drain quickly its a sign of blockages that can range in complexity to fix. Also once drained they should be able to drain as fast as the water comes in. If not they might have a blockage. (h/t /u/admiralkit, /u/hammertonail)
* Hot water tank, capacity, fill rate? Small tanks or low BTU means that you will run out of hot water frequently. This is annoying.
* Soft water? Take a small bottle, fill it with 1-2 cups of water and then put 4 drops of dish soap in it. Shake 4-5 times. If the soap foams up a few inches then the water softener is working. If it doesn’t foam up much (like less than 1”) then the softener could be failing or you will need to buy a softener. This can be a few hundred dollars and often is overlooked by home inspectors.
* Alternatively to the water softener, check to see if the house has a whole house filter installed. Ask the current owner how often it needs replaced and check how much the replacement costs are. They can add up quite fast. (h/t /u/epicluke)
* City water or Well? Check the price for city water, its usually more expensive than you expect. For wells, ensure that there is a bladder (big tank) which is what is used to hold pressure. In either case check that the sinks are not pushing air out anywhere.. This means that there is a leak somewhere which will be expensive to fix.
* Also, if the house has well water check to see how fast the water is replenished. Run a sink until the well turns on (usually indicated by a large click as the relay changes state) then turn off the sink and see how long before your hear another click. The longer it takes the slower the tank file. This can also be acomplished by asking the home owner for well GPM. Low numbers (1-2 GPM mean you might run low on water with company over) (h/t /u/Pm_me_baby_pig_pics)
* See if you can find out what type of pipes where used to supply water to the house. Post 1980 should be safe, but before that they may have used pipes with lead in them. Replacing these can be very expensive so its best to know, and if needed you can take a water sample to a testing facility to test for lead contamination. (h/t /u/zapho300).
* Sewer pipes can be the same. Older houses can have cast iron piping that will need to be replaced. This can be very expensive. Its also possible for a house to have clay pipes which can be destroyed by trees nearby the pipes. For an older house it can be worth getting the sewer lines scoped to check for roots. (h/t /u/zapho300)
* Exterior spigots, do they drip at all? If so that can freeze and cause major issues. (h/t /u/admiralkit)
* If the house has a septic system then make sure you check out the leach field. If its wet or swampy and the weather can not be the source the run away. This can be tens of thousands of dollars to fix. (h/t /u/hyperdream)
* If the house has a thermostatic valve in the shower that keeps the temperature constant then turn it on, let it get to a set temperature, then flush the toilet to see if the temperature changes wildly. If so the value might not be working fully and these can be several hundred dollars to fix. (h/t /u/hammertonail)
* Check the drain pans under the water heater, AC units, etc. If there is water leaking this can get expensive to repair. (h/t /u/x4000)

Venting:

* Make sure that every bathroom has a vent of some sort. Without this you might experience moisture buildup and eventual water damage. (h/t /u/shea241)
* Is there a dryer vent that works? If not this will cause humidity damage and can create a fire risk inside of the house. (h/t /u/shea241)

Media:

* In-attic antenna? Saves you having to have an ugly antenna on the roof. Not an issue if you plan on having cable, but in an emergency having antenna access can be valuable.
* Coax cables for all relevant rooms? Nice for putting TVs up since you will need antenna or cable access. Though this is slowly getting less important as things move to wifi. If it has coax and is 20 years old or less then check to see if it has RG6 (should be on the side of the cable) vs RG59. If the house is newer and has RG59 then the builder was working on the cheap. (h/t /u/umanouski)
* RJ45/ethernet cabling in the house? Where does it go? Also double check to see if its cat5e to cat6. This should be printed on the side of the cabels.
* Wired for audio (speakers in the ceiling?). This is nice as it hides the ugly 5.1 surround sound cables.
* Check internet providers options. Usually this can be done by entering an address in each local providers web site. Its not uncommon for a small area to have absolutely terrible options and nobody wants to live with 256k DSL. (h/t /u/Fluxriflex, /u/lostshell)
* Check cell coverage at the house. Make sure you have decent enough coverage otherwise you will have constant dropped calls at home which is never pleasant and is virtually impossible to fix. (/u/lostshell)
* Ask the existing owner how good the wifi signals are through the house. If there are thick walls, or meshes anywhere it might create large wifi dead zones. (h/t /u/lostshell)
* With any of the pre-existing wiring situations make sure you know where the wires go. Ethernet that terminates in a closet with no power is pointless, as is coax that goes to the roof only. etc. (h/t /u/admiralkit)

Crawlspace:

* Standing water? Run away! There is a leak, or a drainage issue which will basically destroy the house a little at a time over time.
* Rotting in the wood? Run away! This is extremely expensive to fix.
* Too small? Sometimes when they put these in they make them 24” which is really, really hard to work in which can limit your ability to fix or maintain anything yourself.

Basement:
* If the basement has one or more sump pumps, or a perimeter channel (a little plastic edge would be sticking up out of the cement against the walls, and there would be obvious repoured cement around the outside of the basement), it's a sign that the house has experienced or does experience frequent water in the basement from heavy rain showers or improper drainage. (h/t /u/SRTie4k)

Garage:

* Concrete foundation or walls cracked anywhere? Fixing cracked concrete foundations is expensive.
* Garage floors shouldn’t crack any worse than hairline fractures smaller than that is not a good sign. If its noticeably uneven thats not a good sign either. Fixing either of those can be very expensive.
* How many cars? Remember that a “2 car” garage will fix exactly that, so if you want storage space as well aim higher.
* Bollard’s to protect to the equipment? This is not strictly required but can be valuable, especially with younger drivers.
* Access to 220v outlets? this is becoming more and more necessary as electric cars become common. If the electrical panel is in the garage this can be added fairly easily. (h/t /u/ethan-bubblegum-tate)
* Is the floor painted? Is it fresh? This could be covering up a major issue.

Driveway:

* If your area gets snow pay attention to the direction that the driveway faces. North facing will always be shady and therefor will always have ice on it after a snow. East and West will get some sun but it will take several days to clear ice. South facing will typically get full sun and therefor will be free of ice much faster. (h/t /u/admiralkit).
* If the driveway was cut at angles rather than squared this will help with shoveling. This is not required but helps a bunch and is a sign that the builder was thinking ahead.

General conditions:

* Mold or black spots anywhere? Mold will ruin a house super fast, its best to not get involved if there is mold anywhere in the house.
* Water stains on the drywall? This can be an indication of a leak somewhere in the attic. This can be extremely expensive to fix.
* Windows fogging up due to a vapor breach? This can be expensive to repair, $200-$500 a window.
* Anchors, screws, or other such wall damage? These can be annoying to fix and generally make your walls look bad, especially when painted over a few times.
* Ceiling painted recently but not the room? This could be a sign that they are covering up recent water damage in the ceiling. Same is true if an unfinished room has a painted ceiling but no other improvements. (h/t /u/Chordata1).
* Are any of the walls or windows “leaning?” Take a square tool (or something else with a 90 degree angle) and make sure all the corners and windows are squared. If they are not then there are serious structural issues with the home and it should be avoided at all cost. Also make sure that all of the doors open and close without scraping as this could indicate that the house has settled badly as well. (h/t /u/Elan9, /u/jalan12345).
* Older houses can have asbestos in them. If you plan on doing any renovating in an older home you should double check the materials used during its construction. Asbestos can be in virtually any thing in the house, insulation, drywall, tiles, concrete, etc. Getting it professionally removed can cost tens of thousands of dollars. (h/t /u/zapho300)
* In areas with hurricanes or tornados you will want to make sure that the house is built with stronger exterior walls. Make sure the house has 6” thick walls vs the cheaper 4”. You can tell this by measuring the thickness at a door or window. (h/t thiswastillavailable). 
* Popcorn ceilings (the rough texture that looks like painted popcorn) is old, typically pre 1980 and full of asbestos in some cases. If the home has popcorn ceilings be ready to pay a large sum to get it removed properly. (h/t /u/catfishjenkins)
* How well does sound carry through 
* Do all doors and deadbolts fully latch? If not they will strain as they are opened and closed and will break sooner. Knobs are not that expensive to replace (~$20) but doing a whole house to match the style gets expensive. (h/t /u/Useful-ldiot)

Heating / Cooling:

* Check the age of the furnace and AC. If they are older see if you can check the heating block or condensers for corrosion or other obvious signs of issues. These will get expensive to replace. (h/t /u/admiralkit)
* If the house has an oil tank, even if its unused, make sure its not leaking as the cleanup for that can be very expensive (especially if the EPA gets involved) (h/t /u/dreadpiraterose)
* Gas/Electric water heater? Gas is cheapest and easiest to maintain. Check the efficiency to ensure that it is in the 80% range or higher. Electric is expensive but otherwise not an issue, ensure that its 100% efficient. Propane and oil will require regular tank fills which is annoying and often expensive. Each region has different prices for each fuel, check around and see what is cheapest.
* In a hot area make sure that the attic either has an attic fan (should be a large vent on the roof somewhere) or gable vents (a small vent right at the point of the roof every ~3 feet or so.
* Check that the windows are all double pane or better. If you look where the glass meets the frame you should be able to see each individual frame and count them. Single pane will be far less efficient which will cost you money in heating bills later. Replacing windows can cost several hundred dollars per window. (h/t /u/Useful-ldiot)
* If you are viewing in the summer and the house feels hot it might not be well insulated, or the AC might be undersized.

Outdoors:

* Irrigation? This is good, it can vastly reduce the cost of watering your lawn. If you want a green lawn, look for this.
* Trees on top of the underground water or sewer lines? The roots will destroy the lines eventually which will cost a fortune to fix.
* Busy street? This means lots of noise, and will keep your kids from playing in the front yard. Especially bad if the residential road can be used to short cut around a backed up light.
* Shade? If the house has huge trees then it will be shaded which keeps it from heating up in the summer. No trees means that it will be hotter. Same is true for winter though. Pick the season you want to deal with better.
* Any running water nearby? Check the flood plain maps. If the house is in the 500 year plain you will still need flood insurance so you should verify how much that will cost. Do not assume the years you own it will just happen to fall in that 500 year window therefor negating your need for insurance. (h/t /u/thiswastillavailable)
* Signs of Rotational Slump? If the house is on a hill, look for trees near the top and bottom of the hill. If the trees on top of the hill are leaning "backwards" (toward the top of the hill) and the trees at the bottom are leaning "forwards," this is a Rotational Slump, meaning the whole hill is "sliding" downward. This eventually causes fractures in the foundation and there's really no fixing it. (h/t /u/GSlayerBrian)
* Large trees near the roof? If the branches are rubbing on the roofing tiles they will drastically shorten the life. Assume the roof will need repaired or replaced soon if you see this. Roof replacements can be thousands of dollars.
* Large bushes rubbing against the siding will also ruin the paint and finish. They will need trimmed back. Check that the siding has not already been damaged.
* Make sure there are gutters above any place people will travel through (walkways and such) otherwise they will get large drops of water off the roof when they come to your door.

Neighborhood:

* Property line. Look at what is just over the property line. Any trees are going to get much bigger and you can’t do anything about that. Fields will be full of weeds that will get into your yard and may become a source of flooding. Terrible looking houses will get worse, etc. You can not change or fix this, so are you willing to live with it? (h/t /u/cabarne4)
* HOA. Does the home have covenants? If so what are the dues? What do they restrict? etc. Know what you can and can not do before buying.
* Look for bad neighbors. These will make your experience much worse. Things like broken down cars in the lawn, run down houses, etc.
* Go by at different times of the day. Sometimes the badness only comes out at certain times.
* Distance from the airport will establish how loud the airplanes will be when flying by. Also get on google maps. If the runway “points” at the house it will be much worse as they will fly right over top.
* Distance form train tracks is the same. Trains are loud, and often times have to honk horns so expect noise. (h/t /u/pasterfordin)
* House backs up to a park? If so you are going to hear kids playing during the summer.
* Check Zillow for rentals in the area. Lots of rentals means lots of renters and a higher chance of issues with bad neighbors. (h/t /u/YouBetterDuck)
* How decent are the schools? Zillow can give you a ranking. Bad schools will ruin a houses ability to sell later. (h/t /u/YouBetterDuck)
* Get to know the general feel/age of the neighborhood. Being the only person with kids means you might get complains for normal kid activity. Lots of elderly people means that grandkids might eventually move in when they die and they might not be in the same socioeconomic situation as you. These can turn into bad neighbors very quick. (h/t /u/YouBetterDuck)
* Is there a huge lot of undeveloped land nearby? It might become a gas station, walmart, or police station for all you know. Are you going to be okay with that? (h/t /u/YouBetterDuck)

Other:

* How much are the utilities? Ask for recent bills. How much did the house cost them to run? That is an indication of how efficient it is.
* What does your potential commute look like? Take the time to drive it and see. You might find annoyances you never knew about before. (School zones, odd speed limits, etc) (h/t /u/Darth_Draper)
* If you can, meet the neighbors. A loud, obnoxious, or nosey neighbor can negate everything positive about a house.

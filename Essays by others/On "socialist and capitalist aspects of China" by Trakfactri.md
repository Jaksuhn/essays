I don't know, honestly. It's a gigantic country with a lot going on so it's hard to take strong opinions. The Communist Party of China certainly thinks so, and [Xi talked about this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cnAqrQbW85k) during the recent Party Congress. Go to around 3:30. The way I've heard it described from party members is that while China has a market economy, *capital* does not have enshrined rights, and is beholden to political authority and not the other way around.

From one Chinese perspective, the U.S. would be an example of a country where policies are primarily determined by the needs and interests of capital \-\- by various business interests really. Which is why policies never seem to change, even though the parties and presidents swap in and out. Can you imagine the U.S. government going around and [arresting a bunch of billionaires](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/14/chinese-tycoon-reportedly-caught-up-anti-corruption-crackdown-wu-xiaohui-anbang) for buying off politicians? [It happens](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-theranos-sec/theranos-and-its-founder-settle-u-s-fraud-charges-sec-idUSKCN1GQ2HC) in some of the most egregious cases but the punishment is that you basically turn in your billionaire card and pay a fine.

David Harvey, the Marxist scholar, [made a comment](https://theintercept.com/2018/01/21/marxist-scholar-david-harvey-on-trump-wall-street-and-debt-peonage/) on this during a recent interview at The Intercept:

>**JS:** Is there anything in China that you would still describe as, or, if you ever, Communist in nature?  
>  
>**DH:** I think that the Chinese situation is a very kind of complicated one.  
>  
>**JS:** For sure.  
>  
>**DH:** But one that — I’ve gone up and down about this. For instance, Xi has decided he’s going to eliminate rural poverty in two years. And it’s a massive, massive program going on in China right now. And, of course, when the Chinese decide to do something like that they really do it. I mean, when they decided to build a high\-speed rail network they had zero miles of it in 2007. They’ve now got 15,000 or 20,000 miles of it and they just went ahead and did it.  
>  
>**JS:** Well, but in fairness, you know the there is very little regulation in China for these kinds of construction projects.  
>  
>**DH:** Yes, there’s no regulation. There’s no private property rights in your way. You can do what you like. You know I mean, it’s dictatorial in that kind of way. So I’m not saying this is a good system. But it’s interesting that Xi has decided to eradicate rural poverty in two years. And now, people may go on about that in the West. But I don’t see, I mean, can you imagine a program in this country that says it was going to eradicate homelessness in two years? I don’t see it. I mean everybody goes on about affordable housing, something’s gotta be done. But nothing actually really gets done. Xi is going to do it. This is the difference that there is. So there are some very positive things that come out of the China thing, as well as all of the negatives which of course we hear all of the time: lack of freedom of choice, and it’s very authoritarian, party power is being used in certain kinds of ways, and people will talk about all those sorts of things in the West. But what we’re not looking at is the phenomenal transformation that’s going on economically, and in terms of people’s lifestyles. I mean, if you said to people, “Do you want to go back to the kind of world that was there, in say, 1978, or something like that? “The answer would be absolutely not.” That many people there have got a much better life now than was the case back then.  
>  
>So I think that China is something which we ought to be looking at with a critical eye. But nevertheless not this kind of preachy, oh, it’s not like there’s no concern about human rights. As if somehow or other there’s great concern on the ground for human rights in this country.

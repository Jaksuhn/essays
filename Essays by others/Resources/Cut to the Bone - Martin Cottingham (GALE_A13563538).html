<div class="SideNotePara"><p>Competition for foreign investment in free-trade zones of developing
countries has led to working conditions that are unsafe and exploitative.
Workers who oppose management practices have been abducted and killed.
</p></div>
</div><div class="document-text"><!-- FT/IMG --><div class="ParaTypeDecorator rs_skip">Full Text:&nbsp;</div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Jayanthi Dandeniya last saw her husband alive three and a half
years ago at their home near Sri Lanka's Katanayake International
Airport. As 30-year-old Ranjith Mudiyanselage left work that evening, he was
pulled from his bicycle, bundled into the back of a van and driven away at
speed. The next day his battered body was found burning outside a local
church.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Ranjith fell victim to a global trade war that was raging long
before the United States and the European Community fell out over Gatt. It is
a war between third-world countries fighting to attract the foreign
investment their economies so desperately need. Its casualties are the
workers whose pay and conditions are used as weapons to fight off the
competition.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Ranjith had made the mistake of refusing to keep his mouth shut
when factory managers cut corners to cut costs. He repeatedly criticised the
management of Floral Greens, the Hong Kong-owned factory where he worked in
the moulding section, making plastic flowers for export to the Far East. It
was a fatal error in a country where foreign investors are lured with the
promise of cheap labour and harmonious industrial relations.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Now Jayanthi herself is at risk because she has taken up where
Ranjith left off. She works part-time on Da Bindu (Drops of Sweat), a
women's Sinhala-language newspaper that highlights abuses of
workers' rights by companies like Floral Greens.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  The dispute that cost Ranjith his life began when he noticed a
dangerous fault on the machine he was operating during the 6am to 2pm shift.
He informed his foreman and advised that the machine be shut down until it
could be repaired. But the company was not prepared to lose profits by
cutting production.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  They didn't listen to his warning and made a girl work on the
machine during the late shift," says Jayanthi. "Her hand got caught
and a small finger had to be cut off. The next day, my husband asked the
foreman why he did what he did and the foreman assaulted him. His head was
banged on the machine and his nose was bleeding. He had to stay in hospital
for four days."
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Ranjith was suspended for two months, and summoned to a
disciplinary inquiry after he returned to work. It was as he emerged from
this inquiry that he was abducted. He was with an adviser from the
Amandoluwa-based Legal Advice Centre, Maduruppulige Lionel, who was also
seized and killed.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Jayanthi believes an executive of Floral Greens paid the police to
dispose of her husband. The men's bodies were found burning on a pile of
old tyres at the roadside, the hallmark of many of the thousands of killings
carried out by the security forces in recent years. In most cases, the
evidence is quickly removed, but not before the stench of burning flesh and
rubber have struck fear into the hearts of any other would-be troublemakers.
The tactic works: those who witnessed Ranjith's abduction are terrified
to give evidence.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  "I went to the police station and told them about what
happened but the police told me they didn't know anything,"
Jayanthi recalls. "The officer in charge didn't even allow me to
lodge a complaint."
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Floral Greens is one of more than 100 companies that have opened
factories in Sri Lanka's free-trade zones since the government set up
the first zone to attract foreign capital in 1978. Now, three zones each
offer investors duty-free import and export and exemption from tax and
exchange controls in return for a minimum investment of $250,000.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Around 85,000 jobs have been created, a welcome boost to an
economy where over 20 per cent of the workforce is unemployed. Two-thirds of
the new jobs are in garment manufacturing, an industry ideal for countries
embarking on industrialisation. Investment is low, little technology is
required and large numbers of unskilled workers can be employed.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  For union leaders and for many workers, however, the price of the
new jobs is too high. They accuse the government of bending over backwards to
attract investment, giving foreign companies a licence to manipulate their
employees in the free-trade zones. "We call them the free exploitation
zones," says Bala Tampoe, president of the Ceylon Mercantile Union.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  The major problem for the government is that investors can play
third-world countries off against one another. Foreigners can choose to
invest their money where labour is cheapest and industrial relations least
complicated. This cutthroat competition is fuelled by quotas that tightly
control garment imports to Europe and North America. The Multi Fibre
Arrangement (MFA), a textiles-trade deal struck in 1974, guarantees developed
countries over 50 per cent of clothing imports to the UK.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  There were high hopes among third-world producers that the phasing
out of the MFA would be implemented at the end of 1992, paving the way for a
quota-free market in ten years. Instead, the draft agreement drawn up in 1991
remains unsigned, in spite of recent hints from the Clinton administration
that it wants to reappraise the textile issue. The agreement could stay in
the pending tray for months or even years to come as the Uruguay Round grinds
on.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  If quotas were removed it would give the third world a bigger
slice of the trade cake, but could mean a further deterioration in working
conditions. It is estimated that China, the world's biggest garment
producer, could supply the entire European market and half of North America
by itself. Because production costs in China are the lowest in the world,
foreign capital would be switched after the removal of quotas. Other
third-world nations would be forced to cut costs further to keep their
industries alive.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Neil Kearney, general secretary of the International Textile,
Garment and Leather Workers' Federation, is cautious about quotas.
"From a workers' point of view, there is much to be gained from
having regulated trade instead of a free-for-all in which everybody cuts one
another's throats," he says "We need some kind of cooperation
between the exporting countries to ensure they apply the internationally
negotiated standards for workers." Quotas could then be lifted except
where workers are maltreated, Kearney argues.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  But such cooperation between third-world countries is unlikely to
materialise in the ferocity of the textile trade war. In Sri Lanka, the heat
of competition shows in the dramatic difference between the facilities on
offer to the investors and those endured by the workforce. Some of the
garment factories are little better than industrial-scale sweatshops whose
workers are nearly all low-paid women school-leavers. Many have to put up
with sleeping ten or 12 to a room on the floor of private homes licensed as
boarding houses by the government.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  The worst rooms look like car parks - sleeping spaces are marked
on the floor in white paint to pack in as many workers as possible by forcing
them to sleep virtually shoulder to shoulder. Most have to wash at a well in
the backyard and walk miles to and from work along unlit roads. Next to
nothing has been spent on transport, street lighting and accommodation.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  By contrast, Investment Opportunities in Sri Lanka, a brochure
produced by the Greater Colombo Economic Commission (GCEC), lists 24
different financial incentives for foreign companies, offers a register of
potential employees vetted by the government and details a wide range of
fringe benefits for top executives, from private schools and hospitals to
golf courses and sumptuous housing. The brochure boasts of an  excellent
industrial relations climate", glossing over the strikes organised in
protest against low pay and poor conditions.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Gunasiri Weerakoon, the Sri Lanka government's Labour
Commissioner, concedes that housing is a major concern, and admits that bank
loans to help boarding-house owners improve their properties "have not
made much of a dent in the problem". He is less concerned about reports
of maltreatment and exploitation in the factories. "All our laws apply
100 per cent to workers in the free-trade zones: the Industrial Disputes Act,
the Termination of Employment Act, the Minimum Wages Ordinances. If there is
a dispute the workers can always go to a labour tribunal. They can complain
to us and we refer the case to compulsory arbitration."
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  In practice, such safeguards count for little, and reports of
maltreatment are splashed across the pages of Da Bindu. Each month 18,000
copies are printed and quickly snapped up. The women in the free-trade zones
are keen to read about how other workers are being treated, and many are
prepared to risk the sack by passing information about disputes to Da Bindu.
Pseudonyms and anonymous quotations are often used to conceal their identity.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Last year the paper reported the case of a woman who underwent a
life-saving bladder operation and spent five days in hospital after being
denied access to the toilet for much of a gruelling 24-hour shift. The only
medicine she was offered at work was a dose of glucose and coconut water, and
it was only when a doctor was called to her boarding house after work that
her condition was treated seriously.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  In many factories, the management issues toilet tokens to maximise
the time each woman spends on the production line and prevent meetings
between workers that might be used to organise disputes. "The factories
are air-conditioned, so we need to drink a lot of water, but we also need a
token to go to the toilet," says one worker at North Sails, a joint
German/Dutch/Sri Lankan enterprise which makes sails for windsurfers.
"Each worker gets a maximum of three tokens a day, so we can't
drink much water."
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Compulsory overtime to help meet export quotas is commonplace,
even though it contravenes Sri Lanka's labour laws. Employers simply
require new recruits to sign a contract that allows the imposition of
overtime. Workers can then be asked to work overnight at the end of an
all-day shift on the basis that they have consented.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  There are monthly bonuses for employees who do not miss a
day's work, so there is pressure to keep working even when long hours
and steep production targets begin to take their toll. Some factories provide
sick pay only if workers report to the company doctor, and women live in fear
of what will happen if they get pregnant.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  "There is an unwritten acceptance that they take unmarried
women because they don't want to pay maternity benefits or give
maternity leave," explains a Colombo-based researcher, who asked not to
be named. Da Bindu reported that one free-trade zone worker drowned her
new-born baby in the toilet when her boyfriend walked out.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  The root of the employers' power over the work force is the
tight security in the free-trade zones and the huge demand for jobs.
Management can threaten trouble-makers with dismissal in the knowledge that
there are ten people for each job waiting to take their places. Unions and
strikes are not illegal, but emergency powers introduced by the government to
deal with terrorist intimidation allow businesses to take on black-leg labour
to replace strikers.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  "You need an identity card to check in," says one former
worker. "If they withdraw your card, you can't enter the zone. The
way they curb activism is to take away people's cards."
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Samarakoan Menike is one of the latest victims of arbitrary
sacking. A 21-year-old who looks eight years younger, he was sacked along
with 25 other Floral Greens workers after a strike in April. Management had
agreed a new-year bonus of a month's salary for every worker, but this
was cut to a much smaller single payment restricted to employees who had more
than a year's service.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Menike believes those sacked were singled out because they were
activists or long-term servants of the company. Two of the 26 dismissed were
only days away from becoming eligible for a large bonus for five years'
service, while half were members of the joint consultative council which
negotiated with management over labour relations issues.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Da Bindu reports some of the numerous attacks on women which take
place in and around the free-trade zones. Unlit streets used by thousands of
young single women have become a magnet for young men. Women have been
attacked by youths hunting in pairs on motorbikes, some using choloroform to
drug their victims.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  In March last year the body of Irene Indrani, a woman who had been
raped and murdered, was found with a knife still protruding from her neck.
The ferocity of the attack prompted some women to quit their jobs and return
to their home villages.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  Given so many pitfalls, it is remarkable that so many women stay
in the free-trade zones for so long. They stay, above all, because their jobs
release them from the shackles of village life. A survey of 500 workers by
the Christian Workers' Fellowship found that 95 per cent did not enjoy
their work, but most gave "freedom" as the main reason for sticking
it out in the free-trade zones.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  In traditional village society, girls and young women are only
allowed out to go to school or to the temple, and even then they are likely
to be chaperoned. In the free-trade zones they are free to go out with their
friends, to go to concerts and the cinema, to meet boyfriends and to come and
go as they please.
</p></div>
<div class="SideNotePara"><p>  This liberated lifestyle has stirred up allegations of promiscuity
and moral degeneration in the press, and some free-trade zone workers have
even been pushed off buses for fear that they might carry Aids. But the right
to work for themselves is the one freedom women enjoy in the free-trade
zones, and they are not prepared to give it up without a fight.

This question is asked frequently to say to socialists "not all rich people are bad" when we say that their obscene amounts of wealth do not and should not belong to them.

If you are new to socialism, communism or anarchism, you have probably heard from us or others that "the rich don't deserve their wealth/shouldn't have it." To answer why, we must look at the system that produced such obscene amounts of wealth. In capitalism, someone may start a business should they have the prerequsite capital needed. They then hire workers to work under them and the workers are paid a mutually agreed upon wage. To give an example, let's say each of the 10 workers is paid 40,000$/year. Now this hypothetical business specialises in a single product. Each product has a retail value of 100$ and costs 30$ to produce. Each of the 10 workers produces 5,000/year. The total value of the sold product in that year would be 5,000,000$. 1,500,000$ is costs of buying materials, leaving 3,500,000$ to pay the workers. Each worker is paid 40,000$, leaving a leftover total of 3,100,000$ that is then taken by the owner. This amount is called "surplus value". Every business under capitalism has to operate with surplus value or else they will sooner or later fail.

Incomes the socialists. They say that that "surplus value" is labour theft by the employer since he is not paying his employees their full values. So to answer "why billionaires don't deserve their wealth", it is because it is based upon stolen labour value over years that utlimately affects thousands if not millions of workers.

Now the original question is "but Bill Gates has spent so much of his money and uses it for good, why should that be taken away ?". There's a few ways of approaching this question and I will just list them out in no particular order.

a) Bill Gates himself is worth an estimated 90-100 billion dollars, the annual income of Microsoft is around 80-90 billion dollars. Given that the UN has estimated it would cost [30 billion dollars per year](http://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/24/facebook-posts/facebook-meme-iraq-war-dollars-could-have-ended-wo/) (a rough estimate but the point doesn't rely on an exact number) to eradicate world hunger, the fact that Bill Gates sits upon an ever growing amount of money and people claim he "gives so much" is laughable. In gross numbers, yes it is a lot of money that he gives away. In terms of the impact it has on him, it doesn't matter. Assuming he lives to 100, he would have to spend 2.6 billion per year (assuming he doesn't get any more and the value of it doesn't grow from interest or investing) to get rid of it all.  
b) Even if you believe the deeds he is doing, he does it genuinely, does the good actually outweight the bad it took to get that wealth ? And this isn't even talking about just labour theft over the decades, but the monopolisation of an industry, the economic imperialism, controlling of resource extraction, the slave labour of raw materials, sweat shops to produce his products that he sells for more than those workers will make in years if not decades.  
c) As an example, if I live in a commune of a dozen families and I steal 95% of the community's wheat and then years later decide to give 2% of what I stole to the couple poorest families in the commune, I still stole all that wheat.  
d) billionaire philanthropy is pure PR. A large portion of it is used for tax breaks and to hide money in shell foundations. If he wanted to change the world he'd use all his money, not a small portion that doesn't even change the fact that his overall wealth grows annually.  
e) "But he's curing malaria in the third world". He is doing no such thing. He is putting his name on the process and it has generated a lot of positive PR for him since in the 90s he was known as a ruthless bastard. His workers produce products which are bought by customers and the profits from that is funding research that goes into cures. Bill Gates is involved in no step in that process other than his identity is tied to it. "But he made the products". No, he got rich be licensing Windows (an operating system that wouldn't've existed without lifting the concept from Xerox) to IBM and created a monopoly on the operating system industry.  
f) Not all good deeds are entirely good. Just one example of philanthropy with bad side effects is his rewriting of school curriculums and the pushing of charter schools. What gives this man the right to do such a thing ?

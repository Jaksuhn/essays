## Prologue

Humans, together, form societies. We help each other. We live by each other's happiness - not by each other's misery. We do not hate, do not despise, do not hurt one another. Together, humanity lives on this vast Earth. Earth is rich with enough resources to provide for every one that lives on it. We have the capabilities of living free and filling lives, but have lost our way.

The soul of man has been tainted, has barraged the world with hate, has caused great misery and bloodshed. Humanity has developed. Created advances, tools, machines - machines that give abundance. But that was not enough. Greed has overcome humanity and left us with an unfillable void of want. We think too much and feel too little. We have created great machines but we have not created a great humanity. We have become smarter and more clever, but we have not become more kind. Without kindness, caring, honestly, loyalty, trust and wiseness, life is devoid of all that is good and left with a violent evil. What good is that world?

From the horses to ships, to locomotives, to the planes in the sky, from radio to phones, to television, to the internet, all have brought humanity closer together on this large world. The nature of these inventions speaks for the cries of brotherhood - for unity of us all. This message has the potential of reaching billions of men, women, and children alike - victims of a system that deprive us, imprison us, torture us.

The misery that plagues us is not the way of the world. It is but another form of greed - the bitterness of a spiteful few who fear a changing world. The power that the spiteful possess is not their own - it is the power of the people - of humanity. Just as that power was taken from us, it can be taken back. Do not give in to those that rule in their own interest - to those that do not care about you, enslave you, tell you what to do, what to think, how to feel. They see you as as a lesser animal and use you as cannon fodder to fuel their own self interests. They do not treat you like what you are - humans. Those men are like the machines we created - machine men with machine minds and machine hearts. Humans are not machines. We are not lesser than any one else. Humans care for each other - that is the cornerstone of societies around this great Earth. You have humanity in your heart.

You, the people, have the power - the power to create not just machines, but happiness. You have the abilities to make this life free and filling, wonderful and beautiful. That power must be used. Let us use that power together - to unite. In the name of democracy, we shall fight for a new world - one where we all prosper, where we are secure in our lives, where every one has a chance, has an opportunity, where the right to live is not decided by those who do not care. Tyrants say these things to us and use it to rise to power. They lie to each and every one of us. They do not fufill that promise, nor did they ever intend to. Tyrants use those promises to free themselves, not the people that helped them. We must fight to fufill that promise. We must free the world of the oppression - to rid the world of separation, of greed, of hate, of intolerance. We must fight for a world of reason and prosperity, a world where advancement leads to the happiness of all people. People of all nations, of all lands, unite!

## Capitalism

Capitalism is the current economic system of the world. It is an economic system by which the means of production, the country's trade and industry, is controlled by private individuals or private corporations instead of either the state or the people. Why is capitalism being framed as **the** issue of the world? The system that we live in is as deep as you can go when you are digging for problems. Inequality is a problem, yes, but what causes that divide? Why is capitalism being framed as the problem and not some other system? Currently capitalism is the system used by the every country in the world. An argument can be made for Cuba, the only country in the world with >50% public industry control, however even that country has caused debates among socialists as to whether it truly can be considered socialist, or at the very least not-capitalist. Has capitalism been working for humanity?

### Fundamentals
These are problems that are innate to capitalism itself. They cannot be fixed (either completely or at all).

**Accumulation of capital** is the basis of capitalism. Examples within our society include rent, interest, profit, royalties, or capital gains.<sup>[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_accumulation)</sup> Now, why is this bad? Capitalism is inherently an **everexpanding system**. This means that they must continue to accumulate capital if they wish to remain capitalists, for if they did not they would lose to competitors. Eventually you reach a level of worker and land exploitation in your own country that is not sustainable, so you expand operations around the globe.<sup>[[23]](http://rbutler.sdsu.edu/gurely2.htm)</sup> The need for capital accumulation often leads to the generation of wasteful industries that solely exist for profit.<sup>[[24]](https://monthlyreview.org/2009/11/01/what-needs-to-be-done-a-socialist-view)[[25]](https://web.archive.org/web/20100716140329/http://www.worldsocialism.org/spgb/may10/page23.html)</sup> A final note about the effects of accumulation of capital is the creation of non-productive industries that serve to further capital accumulation and nothing else. The most notable example of this being the financial industry, which is one of the leading causes of financial bubbles, which ultimately lead to economic downturns at best and economic depressions at worst.<sup>[[26]](https://web.archive.org/web/20140228090631/http://www.rdwolff.com/content/economic-crisis-socialist-perspective)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970s_energy_crisis)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_1980s_recession)[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_1990s_recession)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007–2008)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_debt_crisis)</sup>

Another core property of capitalism is competition. Many capitalists believe this to be a fundamental right of humans - to be able to go out freely and innovate and compete with others within society.<sup>[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitalism)[[35]](http://capitalism.org/category/competition/)</sup> The fundamental flaw of competition, however, is its **lack of efficiency** for innovation and creation. Instead of having the best minds grouped together and cooperate to innovate and create, you have them competing against each other.<sup>[[36]](http://www.charleswarner.us/articles/competit.htm)[[37]](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/235229)[[38]](https://insight.kellogg.northwestern.edu/article/compete_or_cooperate)</sup> One product of the competition market are patents/copyrights. These laws have been shown to decrease innovation.<sup>[[39]](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/496/transcript)[[40]](http://www.edegan.com/wiki/images/8/88/Heller_Eisenberg_%281998%29_-_Can_Patents_Deter_Innovation_The_Anticommons_In_Biomedical_Research.pdf)</sup> Instead of the patent system being used to *temporarily* provide the inventor with some guaranteed return on investment, the system has been abused and changed, the most notable example being the corporation Disney lobbying the United States' Congress to extend the length of copyright protection in order to prevent their animated character "Mickey Mouse" from entering public domain.<sup>[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act)</sup>

**In conclusion**, the list of fundamental flaws of capitalism are as follows:
 * Accumulation of capital that leads to inefficiency, concentration of power, and wealth inequality.
 * Lack of efficiency that hinders innovation.
 * Constant growth that is unsustainable, causes economic crashes, cut corners and encourages the "race to the bottom".
 * Resource allocation within capitalism does not allocate the basics needed to live either at all or sufficiently.
 * Concentration of power that leads to corruption in every level of life, and competition for individual interests instead of societies.
 * Overabundance of product that is wasted.
 * Markets hindering the field of academia due to results and fields not being desirable, i.e. profitable.

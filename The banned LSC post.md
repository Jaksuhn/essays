There seems to be a lot of people new to socialism in here that think we can "vote away inequality" and class struggle, so let me nip this in the bud.
 
This isn't, and has never been a [functioning democracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8vVEbCquMw) (whatever country you may live in) . We live in a **[capitalist dictatorship](https://theimmortalscience.wordpress.com/2017/02/27/the-state-and-revolution-an-overview/)** (IE Bourgeois democracy / democracy for the rich). The capitalists and their political puppets write the laws, and stack your choices so that you have no choice but to vote against your interests.
 
**Never be deceived that the rich will allow you to vote away their wealth.**
 
There is no way to reform a system that isn't broken. Trying to fix Bourgeois democracy within the confines of Bourgeois democracy, is about as effective as trying to pull yourself by the bootstraps. Please read our [crash course socialism](https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/crash_course_socialism.md) for an introduction to this.
 
Our system isn't broken ; it's working **exactly as intended**.
 
Some might say, "well it seems to be working out fine for me...", but keep in mind that this is the definition of [survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias). [62% of US citizens have less than $1000 in savings](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/most-americans-have-less-than-1000-in-savings-2015-10-06), and [1/7 citizens rely on food banks to survive](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2014/08/17/hunger-study-food/14195585/). "Fuck you, I got mine", is not an appropriate response to other suffering working class people struggling to make ends meet.
 
Finally comrades, we are fighting for our lives right now. The labor shortage is over; Capitalists want nothing more than for us to die off. We're utterly disposable, and even if the [fight were hopeless](https://i.imgur.com/9G5E12s.png) (which it's not) it's absolutely necessary for us to do something to alleviate all the suffering caused by capitalist exploitation around the globe.
 
**There is a path forward**, one in which a tiny ruling class don't exploit humanity, one where solidarity is prized over individualism, one where workers join together and make democratic decisions together, and one where we don't wreck the environment.
 
Please agitate, educate, organize, arm up, and join socialist organizations in your city. If none exist, start one. We have no time to waste; if we don't, the nightmare stories from this subreddit (or those of the victims of [US imperialism](https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/us_atrocities.md) will happen to you or your loved ones sooner or later.
 
Many will be alarmed at the notion of arming up, yet as history has shown, from the Haitian, Cuban, Russian, French, and Chinese revolutions, to the independence struggles of Vietnam and Algeria, to the [bloody history of labor struggles in the US](https://github.com/dessalines/essays/blob/master/us_atrocities.md#workers-and-the-poor), **no ruling class has ever given up power without armed struggle.** A solid rifle can be had likely for less than the cost of the device you are typing on right now. Community defense through mass armament of workers has and always will be a vital part of settling the score between labor and capital.
 
 
There are many growing anti-capitalist groups that you can join both to learn about firearms, and to agitate for the end of capitalism, such as the [Socialist Rifle Association](/r/socialistra), [Redneck Revolt / John Brown Gun Club](https://www.redneckrevolt.org/), [Huey P Newton Gun Club](https://hueypnewtongunclub.org/), the [IWW](https://iww.org/), and [Trigger Warning](https://www.facebook.com/triggerwarninggunclub/). Please consider joining with other workers: [solitary acts of violence achieve nothing;](https://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1911/11/tia09.htm) mass dispossession of capitalists and landlords to serve human needs rather than private profit is the goal we should be striving for.

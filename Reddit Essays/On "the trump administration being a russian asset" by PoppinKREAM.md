I stand by my statement - President Trump and his administration are a Russian asset. The HIC investigation is a farce.

Let's begin with a Russian backed Assad regime assault on a US base in Syria.  We know that Yevgeny Prigozhin gave the go ahead for Assad forces and Russian mercenaries to attack a US base in Syria a few weeks ago.^[[1]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/putin-ally-said-to-be-in-touch-with-kremlin-assad-before-his-mercenaries-attacked-us-troops/2018/02/22/f4ef050c-1781-11e8-8b08-027a6ccb38eb_story.html?utm_term=.d1afa2db0fbf) **Prigozhin, Putin's chef, was indicted by Special Counsel Mueller.**

>In intercepted communications in late January, the oligarch, Yevgeniy Prigozhin, told a senior Syrian official that he had “secured permission” from an unspecified Russian minister to move forward with a “fast and strong” initiative that would take place in early February.

**You might be wondering, who is Yevgeny Prigozhin?** Prigozhin is a Russian oligarch who has been Putin's go to guy for under the table missions, including recruiting mercenaries for the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria.^[[2]](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/world/europe/prigozhin-russia-indictment-mueller.html) Here is a timeline on how Russians influenced the American election in 2016 according the the Special Counsel's indictment. Prigozhin was heavily involved.^[[3]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/02/16/timeline-how-russian-trolls-allegedly-tried-to-throw-the-2016-election-to-trump/?utm_term=.fcb788fad256) 

According to the indictment Prigozhin met Mikhail Bystrov, a leader of the IRA, regularly in 2015 and 2016.^[[4]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/02/16/the-rise-of-putins-chef-yevgeniy-prigozhin-the-russian-accused-of-manipulating-the-u-s-election/?utm_term=.16305299fc4d) Prigozhin funded the Internet Research Agency and their meddling of the American election. This was a sophisticated operation that spanned over several years.^[[5]](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/17/putins-chef-a-troll-farm-and-russias-plot-to-hijack-us-democracy)

This operation was funded through Russian fronts, including a catering company run by Prigozhin. They used stolen American identities. An American selling the stolen identities has pled guilty, although his attorney has stated that he did not know who he was selling the stolen identities to.^[[6]](http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/374267-calif-man-pleads-guilty-to-identity-fraud-in-mueller-probe) Operatives bought political ads on social media sites. Operatives visited the United States, travelled across 9 states and discussed escape routes if they were caught inside the country. Operatives bought equipment including burner phones and SIM cards. This operation included hundreds of employees, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein put it best  - the Russians conducted information warfare during the election.^[[7]](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/02/16/mueller-indictment-russia-information-warfare-416378)

**Want to know why they are Russian assets?** President Trump and his administration have refused to stop Russian election interference, he has failed to create or enact new sanctions against Russia,^[[8]](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/29/us/politics/trump-russia-sanctions.html) in fact they have made a mockery of the process. There were sanctions that were passed overwhelmingly by Congress in retaliation for Russia's election meddling and human rights abuses, President Trump refused to apply all the sanctions.^[[9]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/22/us/politics/congress-sanctions-russia.html)  The administration claimed that the threat of sanctions was enough to dissuade business with Russia. To add insult to injury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and the Treasury Department had been given 6 months to create a list of Russian political figures and Oligarchs with close ties to Putin and all they produced was a list copied directly from a Russian edition of Forbes billionaire list, further indication that the administration refuses to take sanctions against Russia seriously.^[[10]](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-01-30/the-u-s-list-of-russian-oligarchs-is-a-disgrace) A Treasury Department spokesperson confirmed that the list was taken from Forbes Magazine.^[[11]](http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/371399-administration-official-admits-treasurys-list-of-oligarchs-was) 

Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson, was awarded Russia's Order of Friendship award.^[[12]](http://money.cnn.com/2016/12/11/investing/rex-tillerson-exxon-russia-putin/index.html) He has shut down the State Department office that oversees sanction policies.^[[13]](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/10/26/state-department-scraps-sanctions-office/) Tillerson has completely gutted a formerly functioning State Department essentially crippling US influence abroad.^[[14]](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/us/politics/state-department-buyouts.html?referer=) He has systematically dismantled the State Department with major cuts to  leadership roles, these are career diplomats who have served under different administrations and possess unparalleled experience.^[[15]](http://www.bbc.com/news/41921907) President Trump is now instigating a trade war while America's global influence deteriorates. 

They have done nothing while the United States Intelligence Agencies have confirmed that a foreign nation interfered with the American election process, that foreign nation being Russia.^[[16]](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/us/politics/trump-russia-intelligence-agencies-cia-fbi-nsa.html?referer=) The Intelligence Agencies heads unanimously agree that the Russians will attack the 2018 election.^[[17]](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-director-to-face-questions-on-security-clearances-and-agents-independence/2018/02/13/f3e4c706-105f-11e8-9570-29c9830535e5_story.html?utm_term=.acdbe0a94447) President Trump has refused to act, NSA Director Admiral Rodgers admitted last week that Trump has not ordered disruption of Russian election meddling.^[[18]](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/27/trump-russia-meddling-mike-rogers)

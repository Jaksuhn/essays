It is longer away though. And you had "only" 620,000 deaths. Also you didn't do industrialized eradication of of people.

They had quotas. In Ausschwitz they had the quouta of 5000 Jews per day. They had the jews build the gas chambers themselves and then gas them in them. Then they tried out if rat poison would work and it did. 

They would cramp 200 of them into a barge, throw rat poison in, let the gas get out. Have people go in to water it a bit so the shit gets away. Get them out of there. Have the heads shaved to use them in clothing production. Next the dentists would look for gold teeth. And then they would put them either into the ovens or, depending on if there were enough ovens or not, into the fire trench.

The leader of Ausschwitz wasn't fond of the fire trench, because he deemed it barbaric and unfit for a superior and industrial country like the German Empire. The Trench would have other jews or slavs put the corpses in 3 layers with wood inbetween them. Have some channel that would get the fat that flows out of the bodies and collect it in a pond. Then use the fat to further the fire.

It was absolute insanity. This wasn't convitctions pralling against each other. One side being ok with slavery the other not. This wasn't a fight. Alone in Auschwitz were more than double the amount of jews murdered than the entire causalities of the american civil war. 

Yes Slavery was horrible. But you fought for your freedom and won. And this was against each another. We fought against everyone else. Murdered millions. This went to such an extent that you can actually see the declining world demographic during the second world war. And the worst part about it. It was our Grandparents or Grand Grandparents.


Edit: And the outcome now is a country that is entirely designed to not ever make something like that possible again. Or voting structure is specifically designed to stop someone to raise to power the way Hitler did. We have the Euro because it was a requirement of France to accept the Euro if we want to become a unified country again. Our military still has a maximum power it can have. With the unification a lot of military personal had to be fired because the combined military strenght was too extreme. 

In the military itself one of the first things we learned was to never raise our right hand (for example when you want to ask a question). You would only ever raise your left hand. You would also never raise it with an open hand and if possible just use your pointing finger upwards while the rest of the hand stays closed. If possible you raise it without putting your hand into a forward motion. This is all to keep a reporter from spinning of a soldier doing a Nazi Greeting. If there ever comes a photo around with someone in uniform doing that and they find out who the person is, shit will hit the fan for said person.

It is not just the greeting or to stop people being an asshole. The country as a whole from a political perspective is scared shitless to ever let something like that happen again. Never again, this is the whole overarching sentence which will be imposed on germany for at least the next 50 years.

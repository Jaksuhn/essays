Just for clarity: Marx never specifically used the term dialectical materialism. Kautsky was the one who coined that phrase after Marx's death in describing Marx's philosophy.

I'll try to explain Dialectical Materialism as well as I understand it, with the most accessible language that I can come up with:

Okay so this is one of those things that is both really simple but also pretty deep and complex at the same time.

So what is a dialectic? Well it's essentially the metaphysics of an idea - like how an idea shifts or changes as forces (such as other ideas, or things in the world) impact upon it. That might be a bit abstract but we can understand that ideas change over time, and change as other ideas impact upon the previous ideas, creating new ideas. "Dialectics" is sort of a catch all term when talking about those transitions.

It starts with Hegel - important philosopher and one of Marx's big teachers and influences. Hegel was all about "where ideas come from." Ideas were super important to Hegel because ideas were this thing that come out of our brains and let us shape the world with them. Like you get the idea for a house in your head, and then you build that house in the world. It could be like an institution as well - you get the idea for a baseball team, or a government structure, a machine, etc... So the whole concept of "an idea" is really super important because these are the things that we humans project onto the world. So, like, where do 'ideas' come from in the first place?

Hegel put forward his notion: (later termed:) *dialectical idealism*. Basically, for Hegel, ideas came from a spiritual realm (like from God). They transcend the spiritual realm from heaven (or elsewhere) and into our brains, allowing us to use those ideas to change the world. Kind of beautiful, because it presents humans as divine and noble beings, and our consciousness is in communication with divine powers through these ideas.

*Marx shakes his head.*

Now, *materialism* is a concept that you are probably already somewhat familiar with, especially in any atheist/agnostic circles. Materialism is basically the worldview that we are all matter and there is no spiritual realm and there is no God, no magic, no miracles, etc. Just us filthy humans, descended from apes. Marx took materialism as a given and did not spend all that much time talking about it or defending his position.

In brief:

Materialism - the material world begets the immaterial world

Idealism - the immaterial world begets the material world

So Marx "flips Hegel on his head." Marx says no to Dialectical Idealism - we don't get our ideas from God and then project them onto the world. **We get our ideas from the world.** Marx eliminates the spiritual realm and folds the dialectic back onto itself. **We project ideas onto the world, yes, but all of our ideas come from the world in the first place.** It is a two way street.

So the idea of a hammer, for example, didn't come from God telling us we need some hammers. It came from the world - where someone saw that we could use an object to bash another object, and then projected it back from their experience out onto the world into something that can be reproduced and used.

So how does one learn about the world? Simple, **by looking at it.** And how does one change the world? By acting upon it (this is one of my favourite things about Marx - it is not the philosopher's job to simply look at the world and analyze what is going on, it is the role of the philosopher to change the world). This is so simple and so easy on the surface yet so deep and so profound and powerful when explored.

That is dialectical materialism, as best as I can describe it.

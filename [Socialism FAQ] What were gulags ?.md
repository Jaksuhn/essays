*Foreword: I'm not a defender of gulags, forced labour or whatever else you'd like to call them. For the modern day, I do not see them as anything close to a necessity. That being said, some history needs to be cleared up because misinformation in the post-redscare age is ridiculous.*

**What were gulags ?** [**The** Gulag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag) was the government agency within the Soviet Union in charge of forced labour. It was created under Lenin, the first camp created in 1918 and its legalisation came after in 1919. There were 53 camps in total and 423 'colonies'.

**How many people were in them ?** A decade after its inception (1929), the population of all existing gulags was [179,000](https://www.nps.gov/malu/learn/news/upload/gulag_fact_sheet.pdf). In comparison: U.S. prison population in 1929 was [~242,000](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:U.S._incarceration_rates_1925_onwards.png), thus the per capita rate (121m in the U.S. [~150m](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_Soviet_Union#Population_2) in the USSR) is 0.001 for the U.S. and 0.0012 for the USSR. That is considered to be the lowest amount of people in the gulag (not counting its creation period). It's highest estimated population was 2,525,146 in 1950, so the USSR's rate of incarceration for that year was 0.0137 (the U.S.'s rate was about the same as it was in 1929). After 1953, the gulag program, while technically still existed, was more or less over due to the death of Stalin. The numbers after that time were negligible.

Now, that being said, the USSR had a gulag (prison) population of 2,525,146 at its *height*. The height of the U.S.'s prison population was in [2008](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/cpus16.pdf) at 2,310,300 ([22% of the world's prisoners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_incarceration_rate)) with a peak rate of [0.0076](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States#/media/File:U.S._incarceration_rates_1925_onwards.png). An additional 5,093,400 were held in probation/parole in 2008, bringing up the total to 7,312,600. It's worth noting that the USSR sustained a gulag population of 1.5 million+ for only a few years, while the U.S. has had >1.5 million since [~1989](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States).

**How many died ?** A total of [18 million](https://www.nps.gov/malu/learn/news/upload/gulag_fact_sheet.pdf) were imprisoned from 1929 to 1953. Death toll estimates vary widely. Most pre-1991 estimates are very high and do not stand up to scrutiny today - they estimated 2.3-17.6 million deaths. A 1993 study of archived Soviet data says a total of [1,053,829](http://sovietinfo.tripod.com/GTY-Penal_System.pdf) people died from 1934-1953, though the problem with that number is that many historians say it was common practice to release prisoners who were near death or who had incurable diseases. Taking that into consideration, a more accurate number would be [1.6 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulag#cite_note-Rosefielde7677-83) (or [1.5 million](https://www.nps.gov/malu/learn/news/upload/gulag_fact_sheet.pdf) provided by the U.S.'s NPS), though one author estimated [six million](https://books.google.com/books/about/Illness_and_Inhumanity_in_Stalin_s_Gulag.html?id=KSSMDgAAQBAJ) purely on account of soviet data saying that 15-60% of prisoners were considered "capable of light labour", and he arbitrarily concluded 30% of prisoners died on account of the gulag system. Therefore, I'll conclude **1.6 million** of the 18 million total prisoners died under the forced labour system of the USSR - a **survival rate of 91.1%**.

It's also worth noting that the mortality rate of the camps were, on average, [3-5%](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gulag_mortality_rate_1934_1953.PNG) (peak rate of 17%), the upper range occuring during WWII. For comparison, some French labour camps near the same time had [peak death rates of 75%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devil%27s_Island).

**Weren't the gulags just a tool to silence political opponents ?** Was it ever used as such ? Yes. Was it often ? No. Straight from the mouth of the most anti-USSR nation there ever was, the U.S.: "[the vast majority of inmates were incarcerated under non-political criteria](https://www.nps.gov/malu/learn/news/upload/gulag_fact_sheet.pdf)". Not to mention that both in 1953 and 1986, all prisoners convicted of political crimes were pardoned (500,000+ in 1953, 288 in 1986).

**How many stayed in the camps ?** I don't have any *by year* data on camp populations, but a simple 18mn/24 (years) gets an average of 750,000 in the camps each year. If you want to estimate numbers by year by extrapolating the previous [mortality rate graph](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gulag_mortality_rate_1934_1953.PNG) and possibly other sample sources, then you can assume something around 1-2 million on average, yearly, during WWII, 300-600k yearly pre-WWII, and >300k yearly post-WWII.

Getting that out of the way, let's talk release and amnesties. Again, I'll quote the [United States' NPS](http://gulaghistory.org/nps/downloads/gulag-curriculum.pdf) (p. 7) on this: "between 150,000 and 500,000 people were released each year. Some prisoners were even eligible to earn early release, if they worked very hard and exceeded their quotas."

**Weren't they heavily guarded, a la maximum security ?** Not usually. A few were strict camps with "barred windows, locked barracks and restricted movement within the camp zone", a lot were regularly zoned in camps with freedom of movement within the camp but not allowed outside, some were even unguarded camps that had controlled labour but prisoners had complete freedom of movement.<sup>[1](http://gulaghistory.org/nps/downloads/gulag-curriculum.pdf)</sup>

**Alright, I get it. But there had to be *some* bad things with these camps, right ?** Oh absolutely. I can easily say that there is still slave labour going on within the United States' prisons and that their criticisms of the USSR is hypocritical, but I won't pretend for a moment that these were just "prisons" or there every single person within there deserved it. You know why sentences were generally low and there were mass amnesties ? It was easy to get convicted of a crime. Some 'trials' may have lasted minutes if they took place at all. [Article 58](http://gulaghistory.org/nps/downloads/gulag-curriculum.pdf) (p. 6) was a main tool in convicting people easily to be shipped out to camps (the U.S. equivalent being the [*Espionage Act*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Espionage_Act_of_1917) and [*Patriot Act*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act)). And forced labour is forced labour no matter how you spin it. If you were sent there, you laboured. Men, women (pregnant or not), children - no one was exempted.

So I'll conclude by saying that the gulag system was not great. The conditions were often horrible and many people did not deserve to be put there. Was it a human rights violation ? By today's standards, yes (although that does not mean forced labour has been abolished worldwide). By the standards then ? Not really. In short, form opinions around data (and reliable data at that) and don't blindly believe propaganda no matter who tells it to you.

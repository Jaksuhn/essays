In the late 50s, the CIA even creates an "Armee Clandestine" of Asian mercenaries to attack the Pathet Lao. After the CIA’s army suffers numerous defeats, the U.S. drops more bombs on Laos than all the U.S. bombs dropped in World War II.

Rhee became a dictator on an anti-communist crusade, arresting and torturing suspected communists, brutally putting down rebellions, killing 100,000 people and vowing to take over North Korea. He was at least partly responsible for the outbreak of the [Korean War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War) and for the allied decision to invade North Korea once South Korea had been recaptured.<sup>[[1]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Division_of_Korea)[[2]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeju_Uprising)</sup>

Some of the women were gang-raped and their bodies mutilated. Soldiers set fire to huts, waiting for civilians to come out so they could shoot them. For 30 years, the three US servicemen who tried to halt the massacre and rescue the hiding civilians were shunned and denounced as traitors, even by congressmen.<sup>[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Tonkin_incident)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War_casualties)[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Lai_Massacre)</sup>

It protected the Corsicans as they set up heroin labs and began shipping heroin to New York, where the American-Sicilian mafia also flourished under CIA protection. *"Government" is stretched on this country but given the government at the time was provisional and the extent of control of the mafia, it was allowed on the list.*<sup>[[1]](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confédération_générale_du_travail)[[2]](http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/heroin/McCoy2.htm)</sup>

  1980, Saddam Hussein, backed by the US invaded Iran.

Also in 1980, the US funded and sold weapons to both sides in the Iran-Iraq War, hoping to destabilise the region and create a puppet regime favourable to US interests. Over 500,000 people died in the conflict.<sup>[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War)</sup>

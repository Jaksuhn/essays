The "Remembering ..." series is a compilation of the terrible decisions and policies of each historical figure that is intended to combat looking towards the past with rose-coloured glasses.

They turned our area into hell and continuous horror, day and night, we even dream of them in our sleep...In their eyes, we don’t deserve to live like people in the rest of the world and we don’t have feelings or emotions or cry or feel pain like all the other humans around the world.” In 2011 an unmanned combat drone killed his father and teenage brother as they were out herding the family’s camels.

* In July 2016, [a series of US-led coalition airstrikes in Syria killed between 56 and 200 civilians.](http://news.antiwar.com/2016/07/20/us-airstrikes-kill-up-to-200-civilians-in-northern-syria-villages/)

* In February 2016, the United States military [repeatedly bombed a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Syria, killing approximately 30 patients and staff members](http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/least-25-killed-attack-msf-supported-hospital-northern-syria-updated). The punishments doled out to the servicemen later deemed responsible were [largely administrative and superficial](https://www.rt.com/usa/341293-kunduz-attack-discipline-pentagon/).

* The United States government [has been assisting the Saudi military with its extensive bombing campaign and hunger blockade of impoverished Yemen](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/the-saudis-are-starving-yemen-to-death/). A March 2016 estimate placed the civilian death toll of this still-ongoing campaign at [approximately 3,000](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-35842708).

* In August 2016, [this same Saudi-led coalition in Yemen bombed yet another Doctors Without Borders hospital, killing 11 and wounding at least 19](http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/article/yemen-airstrike-msf-supported-hospital-kills-least-11-wounds-least-19).

* Since 2009 or earlier, the CIA’s drone warfare program has [deliberately targeted first responders and mourners who gather in the wake of its own strikes, killing at least 50 civilians in the process](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/2012/02/04/obama-terror-drones-cia-tactics-in-pakistan-include-targeting-rescuers-and-funerals/).

* Despite being advertised as targeted and precise, CIA drone strikes in Yemen, Somalia, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Pakistan have killed a significant number of civilians in general. Most independent investigations have placed the civilian death toll at [somewhere between 200 and 1,000](https://theintercept.com/2016/07/01/obama-administration-finally-releases-its-dubious-drone-death-toll/).

* In September of 2011, [a US missile strike deliberately killed a United States citizen, Anwar al-Awlaki](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/world/middleeast/anwar-al-awlaki-a-us-citizen-in-americas-cross-hairs.html?_r=0). The strike was carried out with the explicit authorization of President Obama himself--meaning that, in essence, the President personally decided to murder a US citizen without trial and got away with it.

* The next month, [the United States accidentally killed Anwar Al-Awlaki’s 16-year-old son, Abdulrahman Al-Awlaki, in another strike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdulrahman_al-Awlaki). Abdulrahman was also a US citizen at the time of his death. When asked about the incident, [then-Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said that Abdulrahman “should have a far more responsible father.”](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/10/how-team-obama-justifies-the-killing-of-a-16-year-old-american/264028/)

* The CIA often [launches drone strikes without knowing who, specifically, is being targeted](http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/04/05/obamas-most-dangerous-drone-tactic-is-here-to-stay/), sometimes even [bombing targets based on SIM card location](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/nsa-drone-strikes-based-on-mobile-phone-data-9119735.html). Although the Obama administration made some vague noises about scaling back this so-called "signature strike" program in 2013, [it is evidently still in place](http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/06/18/obama-cia-returning-to-controversial-drone-signature-strikes).

* Despite [taking credit for ending the Iraq War in 2011](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/obama-announces-end-of-iraq-war-troops-to-return-home-by-year-end/), President Obama [escalated the US military’s presence and involvement in the country beginning in 2014](http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/11/politics/isis-obama-speech/). The number of US soldiers therein [has hovered close to 5,000 since that point](https://www.armytimes.com/story/military/2016/07/11/iraq-us-troops-deploy/86938318/).

* In 2011, the US military under President Obama’s leadership [participated in a successful NATO-led military campaign to overthrow the government of Libya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_military_intervention_in_Libya). This was done [in spite of an explicit lack of US Congressional authorization under the War Powers Resolution](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/22/world/africa/22powers.html). Obama later described his poor management of the aftermath as [his worst mistake](http://reason.com/blog/2016/04/11/obama-admits-haphazard-us-intervention-i). In general, this intervention [resulted in the political and economic destabilization of the country and promoted the rise of extremism](https://theintercept.com/2015/02/16/hailed-model-successful-intervention-libya-proves-exact-opposite/).

* Beginning in 2011, the US government under President Obama’s leadership [has intervened in the Syrian Civil War, training and arming rebels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American-led_intervention_in_Syria) ([poorly](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/27/world/middleeast/cia-arms-for-syrian-rebels-supplied-black-market-officials-say.html)) and [conducting airstrikes](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-23849587), several of which I specified above.
